10 ODES OF HORACE.

approaching. Two words of common use in Latin express
the relation of the so-called Triumvirs to the regularly con-
stituted authorities. Power exercised outside the lines of the
constitution was potentia ; legitimate authority, the power of
the duly appointed magistrate, the duly summoned assembly‚
was potestas. Potentia, of course, there had always been.
‘ Influence' is one of the terms which its meaning includes,
and influence, other than constitutional power, there must
always be. But now for the first time in Roman history,
times of regular warfare not included, the irregular potentia
overpowered the regular potestas. Men inquired, not about
the probable action of the Consuls, the Senate, or the People,
but about the designs of the Three. Of these each one had
objects of his own to secure. Pompeius had to fulfil his
obligations to the legions by which he had conquered the
East; Crassus, the least important member of the con-
federacy, had enormous interests to promote as the first
capitalist in Rome ; Caesar had to construet for himself *the
instrument by which he was to make himself master of the
Empire. A five-years' command in Gaul, both south and
north of the Alps, was his immediate share of the spoil. In
that province he was to bring together and habituate to con-
quest a great army. If we are to fix on any one incident as
settling the downfall of the Republic it was the Lex Valinia,1
which gave him the provinces of Hither Gaul and Illyricum,
together with an army of five legions, for five years. The
Senate was persuaded, how we know not, to add Further
Gaul to his command.

It is needless to pursue in detail the events of the years
that followed. In 58 Cicero was banished, and Cicero
was the only leader under whom a republic was possible,
if indeed it was possible at all. He was recalled, it is true,
next year in a burst of popular enthusiasm, due, however,
not so much to Rome itself‚ as to the Italian voters. For a
few months it seemed that constitutional government might
' yet have another lease of life. But the party which savoured
