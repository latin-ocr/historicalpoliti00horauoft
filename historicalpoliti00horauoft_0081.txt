There is no question of getting into harbour, only of avoiding a
dangerous navigation, the seas that flow among the glistening cliffs of
the Aegean isles.

enemy is a fugitive. Let our merriment be unrestrained.

1. Caecubum. The Caecubus ager was a district on the coast ot
Latium, between Tarracina and Speluncae. It produced one of the
finest wines of Italy, equal, possibly superior, to the F alernian and
Calene vintages. The three districts were nearly contiguouS, being
situate in southern Latium and northern Campania. Cf. VII. 5,
where the same wine is spoken of as reserved for the same purpose.

3. alta domo, ‘high—built mansion ’. Horace, in Odes 111. xxix.
10, speaks of ‘⁴ molem propinquam nubibus arduis’'. The mansion

5. The combination is of the typical string and wind instruments,
a combination as old as Homer, αὐλοὶ φόρμιγγές τε βοὴν ἔχον. The
word seems to imply that there was a duet, and this is what we
should naturally expeet; but then how are we to account for the
differenee os the kinds of music as described in the next line? The
subject of ancient music is full os difficulties

6. illis, i.e. tibiis. The construction is not strictly grammatical,
even though tibiis in the preceding line may be ablative as probably
as dative, for it is not an ablative absolute, as is lyra, with which
hac is in apposition.

6. barbarum = Phrygium. The Dorian music was martial (so Odes
111. xix. 18-19‚ “Insanire iuvat: cur Berecynthiae Ι cessant flamina
tibiae ’')‚ the Phrygian convivial. Plato in the Republic, 399 A seq„
speaks os the difference between the two kinds os music: the αὐλός
was not to be admitted into his model state.

7. nuper, five years before. Sextus Pompeius was defeated by
Agrippa on Sept. 3rd, 36, off Naulochus, on the north coast os Sicily.

7. Neptunius. Pompeius, on the strength os his repeated suc-
cesses (see Introduction, p. 16 seq.)‚ boasted that he was the son os
Neptune. On one of his coins the figure os Neptune occurs.

8. fugit, ‘fled’ from the sea (freto), from which, if the boast of
his sumame had been true, he should have drawn victory. Pompeius
took refuge in Asia Minor after the battle of Naulochus. Such of
