in Horace3 really it is the extreme of indifference to anything but
the Roman point of view. In the mouth of a modern, ‘they died
{or freedom would be a condemnation of the war3 from Horace it
simply means that the general and the soldiers who conquered them
deserved greater credit.

20. Peerlkamp, quoted by Orelli, says: “I do not remember
finding the word prope or fere in a simile in any good poet. The
expression so takes away from its dignity that we are less impressed
by the image. We are reminded that the thing compared is not
quite, but only partly like. A prose writer, indeed, desirous os
avoiding hyperbole, uses such phrases. So Livy (ii. 23), ‘turba
prope in contionis modum circumfusa '.’' Orelli, while acknow-
ledging the general justice of this criticism, suggests that prope is
something like the Greek σχεδόν, i.e. ‘commonly ’. Page, at the
end osa humorous note, excuses Horace on the ground that he was
writing a poem to order.

26. Dauni (Odes 111. xxx. 11.) “et qua pauper aquae Daunus
agrestium regnavit populorum ’'.
