1. amice pati is said by Orelli to be a peculiar usage. It is not
unlike aequo animo ferre and its opposite inique ferre. But it is
stronger; as Page remarks, it is almost an instance of oxymoron.

1. pauperiem angustam, cf. “angusta domi res ’', and “pau-

the wife, him let the full-grown daughter of some warring prince
behold from the hostile walls and sigh ’, &c. The whole passage
expresses the attitude and emotion os the daughter.

9. eheu, expresses the sigh and includes the idea of sear, which
is naturally followed by the conjunction ne.
