in southern Italy snow is something of a portent’', and relates an
experience of his own, “even at Milan'’‚ that the snow of the
autumn of 1807 was met with astonished eries of nevica, nevica. But
the solid streams and snow-clad Soracte of odes 1. ix. seem to show
that very severe cold was not unknown in Italy. The climate
may well have grown milder. Nauck, quoted by Page, regards the
repetition of the syllable is (satis, terris, nevis, grandinis, misit) as
intentional. ‘⁴ It would seem as if Horace were endeavouring some-
what theatrically to imitate the wearisome whistling of the wind in
stormy weather''.

1. dirae, ‘portentous', so diri cometae (Verg. Georg. i. 488).

L 2, rubegte, ‘ red with the lightning glare’. So Milton, Paradise
os ‚ ιι. 1 —

“ Should intermitted vengeance arm again
His red right hand to plague us”.

3. iaculatus, used as is the Greek βάλλω, of the object aimed at
as well as of the thing thrown.

3. arces, the two summits of the Capitoline Hill, the northern

Georg. iv. 393, “immania Neptuni armenta '’, which Proteus was
supposed to shepherd.

8. visere follows egit as expressing a purpose, a very rare con-
struction in Latin, though common enough in Greek. The same
may be found in Verg. Aen. i. 527—8: “ Non nos aut ferro Libycos
populare Penates venimus '’. “Te persequor frangere '³ (Odes 1.
xxiii. 10) is somewhat like it, and is certainly Greek. But it seems
equal to ‘ I am not aiming at breaking thee '‚ frangere being, as it
were, the object of persequor. No such explanation can be given of
egit msere.

9. So Ovid in his description of Deucalion’s deluge, “ Hie summa
pisces deprendit in ulmo ‘’.

11. superiecto aequore, ‘in the overwhelming sea ¹.

12. damae, or dammae, variously translated as fallow—deer‚ ante·
