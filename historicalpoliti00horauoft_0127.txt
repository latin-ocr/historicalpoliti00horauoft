NOTES. 123

17. Possibly an allusion to the myth which appears in the Pro-
ζὲῖξὴειιε, that Zeus was to be dispossessed by a son greater than him-

17. unde, ‘from whom’3 so Verg. (Aen. i. 6), of Aeneas, “genus
unde Latinum ''.

18, 19. secundum, proximos. Secundus, ‘that which follows’
(sequor), i.e. follows hard upon, near enough to come into competi-
tion; proximus, absolutely ⁴ nearest ', yet possibly remote. “ Longo
proximus intervallo '² is Virgil's description of the runner who comes
next to the first, but a long way behind. Wickham quotes Cicero
(Brutus, xlvii. ), “ nec enim in quadrigis eum secundum numeraverim
aut tertium qui vix e carceribus exierit cum palmam iam primus
acceperit ' .

warrior goddess, bearer of the aegis (xviii. 56-7), while of Liber it is
said, “ pacis eras mediusque belli ’'; but the metrical effect is best
consulted by putting a period at honores.

22. Virgo, Diana the huntress, θηροκτόνος.
24 Phoebe, κλυτότοξος.

26. Alcidem, Hercules, so called as the grandson os Alcaeus
(son of Perseus and father of Amphitryo). Cf. Aeacides, applied to
Achilles, grandson of Aeacus. The name is commonly used in Latin
sor Hercules on account of metrical reasons.

2653727. superare nobilem, ‘famed for excelling', the infinitive
being, as it were, a verbal ablative.

27. alba. Probably with an active signification, as Odes Ι. vii. 15,
“albus ut obscuro deterget nubila caelo Ι saepe Notus ’'‚ so “clari
Aquilones ”‚ the north winds that clear the sky.

28. refulsit, ‘shone again', cf. renidet, XVII. 12 3 the re emphasizes.
29. agitatus humor, ‘ wind-driven spray’. (Wickham.)
31. ponto, ablative os place.

33. quietum. “ Duo deinceps regeS, alius alia via, ille bello, hic
pace, civitatem auxerunt ''. <Liv. i. 21.)

34, 35. superbos Tarquini fasces. Tarquinius is mentioned,
not sor his own sake, as one of the worthies os Rome, but as asso-
ciated with the glorious deeds os Brutus. Cf. Verg. Aen. vi. 817—

“ vis et Tarquinios reges animamque superbam
ultoris Bruti fascesque videre receptos?''

The phrase is equivalent to ‘ fasces Tarquinii superbi ', and is thus
an instance of hypallage.
