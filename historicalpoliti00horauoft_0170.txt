WRITING.

Vere FosteP’ S WPiting ..copy-Books, The principle upon which
Mr. Foster’s system of writing is based is that children should from

the very first be taught a current hand. Experience has abundantly
proven that pup pils using his copies soon become fiuent penmon, and
acquire a clear and distinct formed hand of writing that does not
need to be unlearned when they enter business or prolgeaeiond life.
