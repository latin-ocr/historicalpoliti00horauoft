2. praesens :potens, with the additional notion ot readiness, the
construction with the infin. tollere follows on the word being equi-
valent to potens.

4. funeribus is ablative: literally to ‘change the proud triumph
by bringing in the element of mortality’, or more truly to change
the pomp of the triumph into the pomp of the funeral. So in A. P.

dominam before ruris, as if it were, “te pauper colonus ambit
(dominam) ruris ''-

14. stantem columnam, the ‘ standing pillar ' as an emblem
