106 ODES OF HORACE.

20. non sine dis=Greek οὐκ ἀθεεί οι· οὐκ ἄνευθε θεῶν (ll. v. 185).

20. animosus. Page questions, with some reason, the commonly
accepted rendering of ‘ courageous’, and suggests ‘inspired'‚ support-
ing it by the cogent argument that the adjective may have any mean-
ing that belongs to the substantive.

21. Camenae, the Italian name for the muses, probably con-
nected with carmen, as is more clearly seen in the old form Cas-
menae.

21. vester, emphatically repeated, ‘ Yours Ι am when 1’, &c.
22. tollor, middle, ‘ I mount' or ‘ climb'.
22. Sabinos, his Sabine sarni among the hills (arduos).

22. vester must be supplied again before seu, ‘Yours I am ,

whether'.

23. Praeneste, now Palestrina‚ a town on a spur of the Apen-
nines, more than 2000 feet above the sea, and therefore cool
(frigidum). Juvenal (iii. 190) calls it gelida.

23. Tibur supinum, now Tivoli, on the slope of a hill (supinum).
24. liquidae, ‘ with its lucent air'.
25. amicum, ‘because I was dear’, &c.

25. fontibus, as Hippocrene (on Mt. Helicon), Aganippe (the
same), Peireine (near Corinth).

25. choris, dances in which time is kept to singing.
26. See IX.

27. devota arbos, the triste lzgnum, which nearly killed the poet
by falling on his head (Odes 11. xiii.); alluded to elsewhere.

28. Sicula, as dividing Sicily from Italy.

28. Palinurus, the southern promontory of the Gulf of Velia.
We know nothing of the incident to which Horace here refers. ν

30-32. He will go on shipboard (navita) through the stormy seas
of the Euxine, on foot (viator) through the sandy deserts of Assyria.
(Syria is probably meant.)

33. Britannos. There is probably an allusion to the Druid
sacrifices of human victims ; but the island was at this time outside
the range os ordinary knowledge. The epithets applied to the Britons
are ultimi, remoti, διε.

34. Concanum, a tribe of the Cantabri (Biscay). This habitos
drinking horses' blood is not attributed to them elsewhere, though it
is to the Geloni (a tribe of uncertain locality‚ but somewhere near
the Caucasus) by Virgil.

36. Scythicum amnem, the Tanais (Don).
37. altum, ‘noble‘, ‘exalted’.
