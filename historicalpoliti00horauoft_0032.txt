while the prospects os succession were hopeful. Marcellus
indeed was dead, but Julia, the daughter of Augustus, had
borne two sons to her second husband Agrippa, Caius
Caesar in B.C. 20, and Lucius Caesar in B.c. 17. The step-
sons of the Emperor had also highly distinguished them-
selves. Tiberius the elder was twenty-five years old, Drusus
the younger twenty-three, when the two conducted with
brilliant success a campaign against the tribes of the Eastern
Alps (B.C. 15). Drusus marched through the Brenner Pass, and
defeated the Raeti in a great battle3 Tiberius ascended the
Rhine to the Lake of Constance and transported his troops
to the southern extremity. Between them they reduced the
country now known as the Grisons and the Tyrol. Their
victories were celebrated in two odes (XXI., XXII.), but attri—
buted to the genius and piety of Augustus as their ultimate
cause. The poem that follows (XXIII.) is addressed to
Augustus, and belongs to the period of his absencefrom
Rome. The Empire‚ says the poet, owes to him the
blessings of prosperity and peace. Its enemies from without
are subdued; all that troubled its peace from within have
been removed3 all that a virtuous and happy people has now
to desire is that the author of these blessings will again
favour them with the light of his countenance. To the same
time we may assign XXIV. Finally, we have XXV.‚ the
poet’s last tribute to the greatness of the Ruler who had done
so much for Rome. Some crities assign this composition to
as late a year as 10; in that case it must have been a subse-
quent addition to the book. The earlier date seems on the
whole preferable.
