Νοτιεῖς. 1 39

49, 5ο. The authority of the MSS. is in favour of the reading of
the text. Te must refer to Triumphe, and the passage may be
rendered, “Thee‚ as thou passast on, Ho Triumphi will we call
upon (‘thy name will we pronounce’), and that not once only, Ho
Triumph !’' This is not very satisfactory. Te in this stanza has a
different reference to te in the next, and indeed to te all through the
poem, which is addressed to Antonius. Whether the objection is,
as Page thinks, “ fatal'¹, it is certainly very serious.

The alternative is to read Tuque, dum procedis, &c.‚ ⁴ while thou
goest in front', ἃς. We thus get the desired reference to Antonius,
but the reference is too strong. It is true that Antonius might have
a leading part in the procession as connected with the imperial house ;
but, as Wickham remarks, “ Antonius’s place in the procession, if he
had one, could hardly be important enough to bear the weight of
{lhis stiafnffa. It could hardly be applied to any but the triumphator

imse .’

Neither reading, therefore, is satisfactory, and the choice lying
between two evils it is best to give the preference to the MSS.

54. solvet. The terms used in reference to the making and pay-
ing of vows were, it may be said, borrowed from the courts of law.
When the object for which the vow was made had been attained, the
person making it was voti reus or voti damnatus, when he performed
the vow he was solutus.

ff 55. iuvenescit, 'becomes a iuvencus'.

56. in mea vota, ⁸ for the payment of my vow’.
57. curvatos ignes, ‘ the bright crescent’.

58. ‘ Of the moon when she brings again her third rising', i.e. is
three days old.

59. notam duxit, ‘has acquired a mark'.

59. niveus videri, a Greek use of the infinitive. So Theocritus
(xi. 20), λευκοτέρα πακτᾶς ποτιδεῖν.

The studied quiet of this conclusion, besides being in harmony
with Horace’s usual practice (cf. XV111.), suits the attitude of sels-
depreciation which he has maintained throughout.

XXV.

The poet having celebrated the warlike achievements of Augustus,
now praises him as the author of universal peace.

x, 2. lyra to be joined with increpuit, not as the old commen-
tators took it with loqui. ‘ Phoebus rebuked me by a loud and
angry note struck on his lyre.’ So Ovid (A. A. ii. 493)—

“haec ego cum canerem, subito manifestus Apollo
movit inauratae pollice fila lyrae”;
