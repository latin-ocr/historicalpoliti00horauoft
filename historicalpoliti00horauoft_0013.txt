INTRODUCTION.

It is not easy for a writer who has for his subject the fall
of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Empire to fix his
starting-point. The tribuneship of Tib. Gracchus (133 B.C.)‚
or the sixth consulship of C. Marius (100 B.C.), might serve

was a sure prognostic of the new order of things that was
