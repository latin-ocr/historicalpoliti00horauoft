20 ’ omas or HORACE.

midst of the storm from which she had but so lately escaped.
The fourteenth ode of the first book (V.) may well belong to
this time, though it has been sometimes attributed to a later
date, when Augustus was threatening to lay down his
imperial power. My own impression is that it better suits
the earlier occasion. If the poet had thought fit to remon-
strate against the intention of Augustus he would hardly
have put it in this particular form. It is rather an exhorta-·
tion to the country to be true to its best interests‚ to keep to
the safe haven which it has won, than to the ruler to sacrifice
his own ease sor the sake of his people. On September 2nd‚
31, the great battle was fought, and ended in the total defeat
of the forces of Antony. VI. was written as soon as the news
reached Rome, before it was known what had become of the
defeated general. The ode that follows (V II.) is another lay
os triumph on the same event, but written a year later, after
Cleopatra's death. ’

’ On August· 1 in this year (30 13.C.)‚ Augustus entered Alex-
andria. For twelve months more he prolonged his stay in
the East. The provinces of that part of the Empire had to
be rescued from the disorder into which the rule of Antony
had plunged them; the tributary princes were to be estab-
lished on their thrones; regulations, in particular, had to be
made for the future government of Egypt, an addition to the
Roman Empire the enormous importance of which Augustus
was not slow to recognize. Early in August, 29, he entered
Rome, and celebrated three triumphs on three successive
days. Pannonia, Dalmatia, and Egypt gave names to the
three, for such honours could not be paid to a victory over a
fellow-countryman. N evertheless, the conquest of Antony
'was the real subject for rejoicing. The Roman world was
inexpressibly relieved to see power definitely settled in the
hands of Augustus. And it was justified in its confidence.
On January 11th, 28, the Temple of Janus, always kept open
as long as the Roman people had any war on hand, was
closed sor the first time for more than two hundred years.1

First Punic War.
