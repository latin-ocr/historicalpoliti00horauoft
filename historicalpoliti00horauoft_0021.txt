INTRODUCTION ’ 17

In 38 or 37 Horace appears on the scene. His ramous
‘Journey to Brundisium ', described in Sat. Ι. ν., has been
assigned by some commentators to the earlier, by others to
the later year. Professor Palmer, in his edition of the Satires
(Macmillan, 1883), gives convincing reasons for preferring
the earlier date. Octavius in that year was disturbed by the
successes of Sex. Pompeius. Driven to seek the help of
Antony, he sent Maecenas to arrange the matters in dispute
between them. Maecenas was successful, and, early in the
following year, Antony appeared with a fleet. Fresh diffi-
culties arose, and these again were disposed of by a personal
meeting of the two Triumvirs at Tarentum later in the year.
But, as Professor Palmer remarks, ambassadors would not
be wanted, when the principals were to meet, nor, if the
meeting was to be at Tarentum, would there be any occasion
to go to Brundisium. We have to conclude, therefore, that
Maecenas, bound for Greece in the autumn of 38 (a season
which, as Professor Palmer points out, suits various notes of
time in the Satire), was accompanied as far as Brundisium
by certain of his literary friends, among whom Horace
appearS. Towards the latter end of 38, then, Horace is an
accepted member of the Maecenas circle. His first intro-
duction to the great man had taken place about a year
before. This introduction would of itself‚ by the prospects
which it opened up before him, do something to change his
views, to make him more hopeful of the future. He would
be at least disposed to see some merit in the new rlgime.

We are consequently in a position to fix with tolerable
certainty the date of his earliest poems. Epodes vii. and
xvi. (marked Ι, and ΙΙ. in this selection) are despairing
complaints of the times. Rome, eries the poet, is being.
ruined by civil strife‚ and there is no one to apply a remedy.
In 1., there is a mention of the Parthians, which may
be taken with some probability to indicate that the poet
was thinking of troubles in the East. In ΙῙ., there is no
special reference to events of the day; it is an expansion
of the idea that forms the motive of 1., and may be taken as

later, tagii? probably but little later, in date. As aBmatter
