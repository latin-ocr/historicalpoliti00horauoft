NOTES. 73

14. Appiam: the Via Appia would be >the road by which he would
travel to his estate.

14, 15. The Law of Otho (L. Roscius Otho, tribune of the plebs
in the year·67) provided that the first fourteen rows in the theatre,
next to the orchestra, which was occupied by senators, should be
reserved sor persons who possessed the qualification of an eques, i.e.
property amounting to 400,000 sesterces (about A3zoo). It further
provided that no person who was not free-born should be admitted
to these rows. The subject of the poet’s satire had the money aud
much more, and could despise the provision about birth.

17. quid attinet, ‘ what end does it serve?' ‘ what does it profit?’
17. ora rostrata, ‘beaked prows'.
17, 18. gravi pondere, a descriptive ablative.

19. latrones atque servilem manum, the crews of Sex. Pom-

peius were doubtless recruited from all sources, pirates and runaway
slaves among them

IV.

You are going on a service of danger. I am ready to follow you,
not because I can help you, but because it will be more tolerable to be
with you than to endure the anxieties of absence. Nor do I seek fir
any reward. You have already given me as much as [desire.

1. Liburnis. These were ships built on the model of the light
vessels used by the Liburnians, a piratical tribe, inhabiting part of
the coast of Illyricum (on the east of the Adriatic). They had two
banks of oars. Suidas describes them as surnished with brazen
beaks (sor ramming), strongly built, decked, and of incredible swist-
ness.

1. alta. The use of this epithet is a very cogent argument sor
referring this poem to the campaign against Antony rather than to
that against Sex. Pompeius. Florus says os Antony's ships at Actium,
“turrium atque tabulatis allevatae castellorum et urbium specie''.
Some had as many as nine banks of oars. Plutarch speaks of the
wooden towers which Antony's ships carried, and Dio Cassius repre-
sents him as encouraging his troops by pointing out to them the size
and strong construction of the ships. So Virgil (Aen. viii. 691-3).

“ pelago credas innare revolsas
Cycladas, aut montes concurrere montibus altos 3
tanta mole viri turritis puppibus instant”.

4. tuo, tle. periculo. The usage is much the same as in “rem
periculo meo ger0”: ‘ at risk to yourselP, or possibly it has a quasi
instrumental force, ‘ to help out Caesar's perils by your own'.

5. quid nos? ‘what are we to do?'

5, 6. The construction is somewhat awkward and confused. Sit
has been conjectured sor si, and would get rid of the difficulty.
