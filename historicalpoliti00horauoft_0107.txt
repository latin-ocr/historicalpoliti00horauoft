NOTES. 103

33, 34. lucidas sedes=arces igneas, cf. line 10.

34. ducere, ‘ to quaff'. The various reading of discere, ¹ to grow
accustomed to ’, is discussed at length by Orelli, who remarks, how-
ever, that “ de nectare potando nescio quid habet ridiculi ”.

35. adscribi, ‘to be ext->1³31 amgngss, used <}s soldiers, ῗῐοῃίεἳ,

(line 17) gives it some probability.

35. quietis is an allusion to the Epicurean notion os gods undis-
turbed by mortal troubles; so in Sat. 1. v. 101, “ namque deos didici
securum agere aevom ”.

37. dum :dummodo, ‘provided that ’. ,

38. exsules, with a certain touch of seem, cf. Verg. Aen. vii.
359, “ Exulibusne datur ducenda Lavinia Teucris ’'.

39. beati‚· emphatic, ‘let them have power and wealth ⁵.

41. insultet, ‘leap upon', ‘trample’. The poet transfers to the
cattle the feeling of contempt which an enemy might feel, as in ll.
lv. 496, τύμβῳ ἐπιθρώσκων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο, and Eurip. Elect. 327
Aegisthus ἐπιθρώσκει τάφῳ of Agamemnon.

42. stet. “ Emphatic bo'th by itself and by its position.'' (Page.)

d 4²·- ‘Capitolium‚ as the visible centre and symbol of Roman
omlnlon.

43. triumphatis, the passive os triumpho (properly a neuter verb,
used by itself and with the preposition de) is used in the passive as
nearly equal to vinco by the poets and post-Augustan prose-writers.
So Verg. Georg. iii. 33, “triumphatae gentes ''

44 ferox, ‘haughty', ‘in her pride ’.
44. dare iura, of sovereignty, ‘ impose her rule ’.

45. late to be joined with horrenda, as in odes 111. xvii. 9, “late
tyrannus '', and Verg. Aen. i. 21, “‘ populum late regem ''.

46-48. From the west, where the ‘ intervening sea divides Europe
from Africa ’, to the east, ‘where the rule’, &c. The description
takes in the whole length os the Mediterranean.

49—52. The first condition is given, the particle dum having to
be supplied. The ruler of the world must despise the allurements
of wealth. ‘He must be more resolute in scoming (a somewhat
strange use os the infinitive) gold, always best lest undiscovered‚
than in gathering it with hands that seize sor human ends all con-
secrated things.’ To connect humanos in usus with rapere seems
better to suit the sense, with cogere, the sound.

53. obstitit, ‘has been set’.

54. visere. The word gives the 'idea of exploring. It governs
partem, which by a common usage is expressed with the relative.
