NOTES. 105

This seems better than Wickham’s somewhat complicated explanation
which reduces the alternatives to two: (1) the voice accompanying
the tibia, and so high (acuta); or (2) accompanying the eithara and
deep (grows) In either case it is necessary to read citharaque in-
stead of citharave, though the latter is supported by all the MSS.

5. auditis,‘ do you hear her answer?
5, 6. amabilis insania, ‘ some sair delusion'.

6. pios, ‘holy’‚ from which the prqfiznum volgus is included.

8. subeunt applies more strictly to aquae, ‘which pleasant
streams and breezes traverse'.

9. me is emphatic. ‘It was I whom.'
9-12. fabulosae palumbes, ‘the doves os story’.

9. Volture in Apulo. The obvious difficulty here is that in
line 9 the mountain Voltur is described as being yLlpulus, while in
line 10 the poet, wandering on this same mountain, is said to be
wandering‘ outside the boundary of his native Apulia'. This diffi-
culty' is aggravated by the sact that the ‘'A in Apulus is long, the

‘'A in Apuliae short, a very strange metrical license. There is,
indeed, in certain MSS. a various reading limina Pulliae. And
this one of the scholiasts explains as meaning bey ond the door of
my nurse Pullia'. This is not attractive. Nothinyg could be more
unlikely than for Horace to introduce the quite unknown name of
his nurse into a poem os this serious kind. A number of conjectures
have been made, as abdito, arduo, arido, avio for Apulo, not to speak
of what have been suggested for the next line. Page rightly prefers
avio3 but even this' is not one of the irresistible kind.

11. ludo fatigatumque somno, an adoption os the Homeric

καμάτῳ ἀδηκότες ἠδὲ καὶ ὕπνῳ (Il. x. 98). It is an instance of
zeugma. The child was wearied with sport and (merpowered,

oppressum) with sleep.
12. palumbes, ‘ring-doves’.

13. texere. Orelli quotes some similar stories, as ag how a
htingal gale settled on the mouth os the infant Stesichorus? how the
Wltalpth 51:231ae was laid on laurel and myrtle leaves and fed by bees

13. mirum quod foret, ‘to be a marvel’ ; the subjunctive ex-
presses a consequence rather than a purpose.

F 14—16. All three names survive. Acerenza, Sta. Maria de Bandi,
orenza.

14. nidum, i. e. nestling among the hills.

15. saltus, ‘ woodlands’.

17. ut depends upon mirum, ‘how I could sleep‘.

18. premerer, ‘be covered’.

18. sacra, consecrated, the laurel to Apollo, the myrtle to Venus.
