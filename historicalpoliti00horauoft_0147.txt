NOTE ΟΝ VI. 21—24

Pliiss suggests a totally different interpretation of these lines, and
finds a supportet, somewhat, I must own, to my surprise, in Pro-
fessor Sellar (Horace and the Elegiae Poets, p. 124). According to
his view the dux of line 22 is not Augustus but Cleopatra, who is
compared to Jugurtha in 21-2 and to Hasdrubal in 23—4‚ and pro-
nounced to be more detestable than either. Propertius is quoted to
show that the parallel between Jugurtha and Cleopatra had suggested
itself to a Roman poetz— „

“ Di melius! quantus mulier foret una triumphus .
ductus erat per quas ante Iugurtha vias' (xv. vi. 65, 66).

Hasdrubal had declared at the final siege of Carthage that he
would find his tomb in the ruins of his native city, but afterwards
condescended to beg his life of Scipio. This, says Professor Sellar,
affords the only rational explanation of the words—

· “ Cui super Karthaginem
Virtus sepulchrum condidit .

This interpretation in its entirety is Pliiss’s own, but it was antici-
pated so far as the identification of ducem with Cleopatra, an idea
of which Orelli says, “ mire nuper quidam exposuit”, διο. It seems
almost impossible that Horace should use so well-known a cognomen as
“Africanus’', familiarly applied to the two Scipios and never applied
to any one else, of Hasdrubal. Horace is seldom obscure, but, if
this was his meaning, it must be allowed that he concealed it with
the greatest success. The same must be said of “ Cui super Kar-
thaginem’', &c. 1f it is intended sor irony, it missed its effect for
more than e' hteen centuries. Velleius Paterculus must have
understood it o Scipio when he wrote, for the allusion is scarcely
doubtful: “ Virtus dea voluit ut Karthaginis parietinae sempiternum
oesent Scipionis Minoris monumentum'’. The old commentators
did the same, for they invented, after their manner, a story of how,
at the bidding of an oracle, a statue of the Elder Africanus was
erected at Ostia with the face turned to Carthage. It should be
noted that Livy (xxxviii. 56) speaks of the burial-place of the Elder
Africanus being unknown. What then more natural than sor the

poet to say that his valour made his real burying-place in the Car—
thage which he had conquered!
