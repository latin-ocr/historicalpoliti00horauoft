126 onus OF HORACE.

An eagle grasping a thunderbolt is especially frequent on the coins
of the Ptolemies.

2. regnum. Pindar (Olymp. xiii. 21) speaks of the eagle as
οἰωνῶν βασιλεύς.

2. vagas, ἠερόφοιτος, given as the equivalent of vagus, does not
appear as an epithet of birds. If there is the feeling of ‘ truant ’ in
the word, as Wickham suggests, we might quote κουφόνοος used by
Sophocles of birds.

3, 4. So Verg. Aen. v. 255—

“ quem praepes ab Ida
sublimem rapuit pedibus Iovis armiger uncis ''.

4. in, ‘in the case οἷ’.
5. olim, ‘long ago’.
5. ‘ Youth and the vigour of his sires.'

6. propulit is the reading justly preferred to that which has the
best MSS. authority, protulit.

6. inscium, ‘yet unconscious ’. The early efforts of the bird are
a matter of instinct only.

7. verni: the elder Scaliger (Julius Caesar, who must be distin·
guished from his son Joseph, a far superior critic) objected that young
eagles do not fly before August, and proposed vernis. As Page re-
marks, “even by thus making the line intolerable he only gets to
the beginning of summer’'. The criticism is preposterously absurd.
Horace knew and cared nothing about the habits of young eagles.

9. venti paventem, an emphatic collocati0n; the winds make
him shudder, yet they help him to fly.

9. mox, ‘ next '.

10. impetus, always used for impulse from within, while im-
pulsus means motive force from without.

11. nunc, to-day, the last stage in its growth.

11. reluctantes. The word pictures the snake struggling to get
so far back as to be able to strike. So Verg. Aen. ii. 751—

“ saucius at serpens sinuosa volumina versat,
arrectisque horret squamis et sibilat ore
arduus insurgens ”3

and Cicero in the Marius :—
“ anguem
semianimum et varia graviter cervice micantem ''.

3-15. ‘ Or such as the newly-weaned lion, whomss &c.
13. caprea, ‘roe-deer’, distinguished from capra, ‘she-goat'.

14, 15. Page partly approves, but does not adopt Nauck’s method
os placing a comma at ubere3 the young roe-deer has just left its
