Fortune, the all-powerficl, the deity whom htgrlz and low unite in
worshipping, is besought to preserve A agustus in the great and peril-
ous undertaking which he is about to commence.

1. Ο diva: the Fortuna invoked in this Ode must3be taken as the
Fortuna Publica, occupying, it may be said, something of the same
place with regard to the State, as did the genius with regard to the
individual. She is not the blind goddess, with the sinister passion
sor pulling down and building up, but the Fate of the Roman People.
(Other forms of Fortune were worshipped with analogous suncfions,
as Fortuna Muliebris.) Wickham quotes from Plutarch (De Fortuna
Romanorum), “Even as Aphrodite, when she crossed the Eurotas,
laid aside her mirror and her ornaments and her cestus, and took
spear and shield, to adom himself for Lycurgus' eyes, so, when after
her sojourning with Persians and Assyrians, with Macedonians and
Carthaginians, she (τύχη) approached the Palatine, and crossed the
Tiber, she laid aside her wings, and took off her sandals, and left
behind her ball, the symbol of fickleness and change ‘’.

1. Antium, the old capital of the Volsci, one of the chief seats
(Praeneste was the other) of the worship of Fortune. The deity was
