144 ODES OF HORACE.

APPENDIX C.

 

NOTE ON xv, 40.

It has been remarked with perfect truth that one of the causes which
reconciled Horace to the imperial rdgime was the element of culture
which it contained. Nor was this only a consideration of personal
advantage. He willingly conceded to a despot who was at the same
time a munificent patron of letters the allegiance which he would
have been reluctant to allow to a rude soldier of the Marius type.

Of the patronage which Augustus and his minister Maecenas
bestowed upon the writers of the time enough has been said by
others. The chief part of the eredit doubtless belongs to the minister,
who had, however, it must be remembered, opportunities of becom-
ing acquainted with the men and their work which his master
lacked. Augustus's absences from Rome were long and frequent
during the earlier part of his reign, and the business of govemment
which fell upon him must have been almost overpowering. But
what Suetonius tells us of his personal accomplishments in this direc-
tion is peculiarly interesting. Suetonius was secretary to Hadrian,
and had access, it would seem, to manuscripts of Augustus which
were probably preserved with other personal belongings of the great
emperor. He gives many particulars about his orthography and
handwriting, learnt, he tells us, from inspeetion of the originals.

Augustus was from his earliest years a diligent and eager student.
He was actually working under an eminent teacher at Apollonia when
he was called to take an active share in political life by his uncle's
death. From that 'time no press of occupatiori, civil or military,
could wholly keep him away from his books. He wrote in prose,
“ Reply to Brutus about Cato ''‚ “ A Praise of Philosophy’ , and
“ An Autobiography ’³ ——thirteen books, reaching as far as the year
22 B.C. In verse he was the author of an hexameter poem on Sicily,
and of a small volume of Epigrams. A more ambitious attempt was
a tragedy on the subject of Ajax. In this he did not persevere.
“ How fares Ajax?’' a friend once asked him. ‘Z‘Fallen on his
