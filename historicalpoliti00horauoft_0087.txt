flooded stream dashed against the Tuscan or right bank os the river,
and was hurled back from that (it being high ground) on to the
low-lying left bank. I agree with Page in preferring (2). His illus-
tration of the Surrey side of the Thames being made more liable to
flood by the construction os the embankment on the Middlesex side
is apposite. But when he says that the theory of floods being “ due
to the wind blowing violently against the mouth of a river and pre-
venting the efflux of its waters’' is absurd, he is in error. It has
always been said that the city os St. Petersburg would be greatly
endaugered if a long continuance of west winds should coincide with
beavy floods. A strong east wind aggravates the floods by which he
himself illustrat& his view. Litus is not unsrequently used of a
river bank.

15, 16. monumenta regis, the palace of Numa, commonly called
Regia simply, and the temple of Vesta stood close together in the

17·—19. Ilia, otherwise Rhea Silvia, is supposed to urge her hus-
band the Tiber‚ by complaints which he could not bear to hear, to
avenge the murder of her illustrious descendant Caesar by the de-
struction of Rome, the temple of Vesta being the badge os empire.
Jupiter “qui terreri voluit populum, non perire'’ does not approve
of vengeance so excessive.

21, 22. cives; the word is emphatic, and implies that citizens
sharpened the sword against fellow-citizens‚ the following clause,
‘⁶ quo graves Persae melius perirent ³¹, strengthening the implication.

22. graves Persae. The Parthi, originally oceupying a moun-
tainous district east os Media, asserted their independence of the
kings of Syria in 256 B.c., their leader being a certain Arsaces.
Under the dynasty thus founded they continued to occupy a con-
siderable part of the Persian empire. Hence they are frequently
called Persae by the poets. Parthia was the only power that could
pretend to be a rival of Rome. (Hence the -important place as-
signed to it in the view of the world in Paradise Regained.) Τῑιε
epithet graves expresses the sear which the Parthians inspired at
Rome (see Introduction, p. 16).

23, 24 vitio parentum rara, ‘thinned by their fathers' guilt'.

25, 26. ruentis imperi rebus; rebus is the dative, following

of our {alling rule ’. Imperium: ‘ military sway ’.
