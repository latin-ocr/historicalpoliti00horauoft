12 ODES OF HORACE.

operations in which he crushed all opposition, foreign and
domestic, Caesar entered Rome its undisputed master.

At this time Horace, who was born on the 6th of December,
65, was in his nineteenth year, and had been for some time
a student at Athens. His father was an emancipated slave,
possibly, if we may hazard the conjecture, a Greek by birth‚1
who had realized a small fortune in his employment of
auctioneer's clerk. The confiscations which followed the
alternate triumphs of hostile parties in Rome must have put
plenty of business into the hands of those who followed
this profession. Horace's father, who probably married late,
his son not having been born till five years after his emanci-
pation, must have profited by the busy times which followed
the victory of Sulla.² His means were not indeed large, but
they were sufficient to meet a considerable expenditure on his
son’s education. This was carried on for a time, i.e., between
the poet's twelfth and eighteenth year, under the best teachers
at Rome, and was completed at Athens, whither it was be-
coming the fashion for the Roman youth to proceed at about
the same age at which a university career among ourselves is
now commenced.

Great events meanwhile were happening in the world
of politics. After a stay of four months in Rome, Caesar
set out for Spain, where the sons of Pompeius had collected
a strong force. He won the battle of Munda on March
17th, 45, and entered Rome again in the beginning of
October. About six months afterwards, March 15th, 44, he
was assassinated, and the final struggle between republicanism
and imperialism commenced.

Horace was now in his twenty—first year. What his per-
sonal leanings in political matters may have been we have no
means of knowing‚ but it may be conjectured with no little

1 Horace, though he speaks most affectionately and gratesully of his father,
tells us nothing about the facts of his life, except his social rank and his
employment. The conjecture osa Greek descent rests upon the poet's enthusi-
astic love of Greek literature. No other Roman writer knew so much os it or
imitated it with such success.

² This was in 81, when the elder Horace may have been about forty years of
age.
