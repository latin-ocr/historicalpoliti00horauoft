84 ODES OF HORACE.

but it is found in Cicero, as in Ad Att. xi. 15, “ Quintus non modo
cum magna prece,'' &c.

27. virgines sanctae, the vestal virgins. The chief meanings
of sanctus would be combined in them, viz.‚ personal purity, con-
secration‚ inviolability. Orelli quotes Cicero (pro Fonteio, 17),
“Virgo Vestalis quae pro vobis liberisque vestris tot annos in dis
immortalibus placandis occupata est ’'.

27. minus, used as equivalent to non. It is an instance of the
euphemism found in all languages, and common in Greek and Latin.
Vesta turns a deas ear in her wrath at Caesar's death. Cf. Ovid
(Fasti, iii. 699), “Ne dubita, meus ille suit, meus ille sacerdos; Ι sacri·
legae telis me petiere manus ”.

28. carmina, ‘ chants' ; the word is used of set forms of prayer.

29. scelus, the ‘crime’ os Caesar’s death; partes the ‘office’3
there is a special usage of the plural of pars in this sense. ’

30. venias, in prose would be preceded by ut.

31. umeros is the accusative after the reflexive amictus The
god veils with a cloud the splendour of his shape.

32. Apollo, invoked (1) as generally the Deity of cleansing and
healing3 (2) as the tutelary deity of Troy, with which Rome claimed
a close connection. Suetonius mentions a story in which Apollo
was said to be the father of Augustus, but it is very doubtful whether
there is any allusion to it here or in the “tuus iam regnat Apollo ”
of Verg. Ecl. iv. 10. A flattery so gross does not grow up early.

33-35. We may understand precamur venias with the mention
of both Erycina and Mars, “ or come, Venus, if thou preferrest... or
thou, Mars, if thou regardest”.

33. Erycina ridens, φιλομμειδής Ἀφροδίτη, called Erycina from
the great temple (originally erected to the Phoenician Astaroth) on
the promontory of Mt. Eryx. Venus, of course, is invoked as the
mother, through her son Aeneas, of the ruling raee of Rome,
“ Aeneadum genetrix '’.

36. respiciS, ‘ regardest '3 ‘ re ’ gives the sense of duty.

36. auctor, ‘first founder'‚ as according to the legend of Mars
and Rhea Sylvia.

37. ludo. War with all its horrors is a sport to Mars, as change
is the sport of Fortune, “ ludum insolentem ludere pertinax ”. With
satiate compare the Homeric ἆτος πολεμοῖο.

39. Mauri. Bentley conjectured Marsi, on the ground that we
never hear of any Moorish soldiers not mounted. Orelli suggests
that the Maurus was pedes for the time only, having been unhorsed.
For Marsi there is no MS. authority. The difficulty of Mauri is
not insuperable. It may be used generally for African, and so in-
clude Carthaginian soldiers.
