86 omas or HORACE.

7. fregi. Orelli takes this to mean ‘made shorter’; Wickham
refers to Odes 1. i. 20, “ partem solido demere de die ”3 Page trans-
lates ‘ defeated ’. The epithet morantem does not, it must be con·
fessed‚ suit either rendering very well. On the whole it is possibly
better to speak of taking a part out of than of breaking the back of
a lingering day, a process which would hardly “ make it move along
very fast and pleasantly ²², as Page puts it. ‘ Shorter' expresses the
sense, but does not explain the collocation of fregi morantem.

7. coronatus may be taken as a middle participle followed by
ἓὲἕιίᾆξέζ· ‘while I garlanded my locks, that glistened with Syn'an

8. malobathro, probably a kind of bay, and thence the perfumed
oil extracted from it. It is called Syrian because it was obtained
from the further east through Syrian traders. The Elder Pliny,
however (but heis not always to be trusted), declares that the plant
grows in Syria. So in odes 11. xi. 16 we have Assyria nardo.

9. Philippos et celerem fugam, ‘the headlong rout of Philippi ’‚
ΞΠ 1i191s2t)anee of hendiadys, as “pateris libamus et auro '² (Verg. Georg.

10. sensi, ‘Iknow to my eost ². The word is often used, says
Orelli, of grievous and painful circumstances.

10. relicta non bene parmula. Horace is thinking of Alcaeus’s
confession of having lost his arms, which the enemy had hung up in
a temple, while he had himself escaped with his life. With this
precedent before him, and aware that a half-humorous confession of
weakness (ef. the “imbellis et firmus parum '' of IV. 16) would take
the sting out of any reproach that might be addressed to him, he
allows that he fied in the hour of defeat. The language is carefully
suited to the occasion, the diminutive parmula, ‘ my poor little
shield '‚ lessening the force of non bene, which would otherwise
mean, as Page says, ‘ most disgracefully ³. The same effect is carried
on by the following lines. ‘ Valour itself was vanquished that day,
and the boldest warriors bit the dust.'

12. tetigere mentozwere laid low. This is far· better than the
interpretation favoured by Orelli that the vanquished came in sup-
pliant guise, bending to the very ground, to beg their lives from the
conqueror. Some, doubtless, did so, but it weakens the force of the
poet’s language. turpe may mean ‘foul with blood', or simply
‘dishonouring’. All defeat, especially if it follows the confidence
implied in minaces, is in a way dishonouring.

13. Mercurius, the special protector of poets, whom Horace
includes under the description of viri Mermriales, 11. xvii. 29.

14. denso a'e're burlesques rather than satirizes Homer. No
one feels any anomaly when Aphrodite rescues Paris and Apollo
Aeneas by enveloping them in mist (ἠέρι πολλῇ); but to transfer the
