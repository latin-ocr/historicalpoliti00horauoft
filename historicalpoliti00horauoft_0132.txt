128 omis οῖ HORACE.

29—36. The poet goes on to insist on the two necessary qualifica-
tions of greatness, good blood, and good education. There must be
hereditary qualities, and these must be trained.

29. So Eurip. Frag. (Alcmena) :—

‘¹ ὡς ἀληθὲς ἢν ἄρα
ἐσθλῶν ἀπ’ ἀνδρῶν ἐσθλὰ ’γίγνεσθαι τέκνα. ”

29. creantur z nascuntur.

29. fortibus et bonis. Suetonius says that ‘Nero’ is a Sabine
word signifying ‘ fortis ac strenuus ⁷.

33. After exalting the doctrine of ‘heredity’, Horace goes on to
give due credit to training. ‘ But it is teaching that brings out the
inborn power.'

34. recti cultus, ‘right discipline ⁹. It is not easy to say why
the plural, except it be for euphony.

35. utcunque, ‘whenever’.
35. mores, ‘conduct' τῖε. the habit of virtue.
36. bene nata, ‘ what is noble by nature '.

37. Neronibus. The family was an offshoot of the Claudii,
having forits ancestor the fourth son of App. Claudius Caecus (Censor
312 Β. C. ). C. Claudius Nero, aftervarious services in the Second Punic
War, was Consul in 207, M. Livius Salinator being his colleague. He
was acting against Hannibal in Southern Italy when he heard of the
approach of Hasdrubal, who was bringing up a fresh army to rein-
force his brother. Nero at once marched north to join Livius, who
was stationed in Umbria. The combined armies defeated Hasdru-
bal at the river Metaurus. It is doubtful whether this victory can
be said to have “saved Rome’'. This had been done by the capture
of Capua and Tarentum, it might be almost said, by the first defeat
inflicted on Hannibal. What the victory really did was to practically
finish the war.

38. Metaurum, agreeing with flumen3 it was the Metaurus.
L 39. p'ulcher, &c.‚ ‘shining sair when the darkness was chased from
atlum .

41. adorea-:victorina “probably'' (according to Key) “a cake
of spelt given in token of victory ''. So Plautus (Amphit. 1. i. 78),
“qui praeda agroque adoreaque adfecit populares '’.

41, 42. primus ut, ‘ first after the day that ’.
42. dirus, a stock epithet of Hannibal.

43. taedas, ‘pine trees ’‚ the pitclz-pine tree. Orelli speaks of a
conflagration of pine woods having taken place in the Tyrol in 1797
(forty years before the publication of his Horace). Α similar dis-
aster has happened in the pine woods of Hampshire.
