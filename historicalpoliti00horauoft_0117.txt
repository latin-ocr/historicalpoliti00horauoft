noras. 1 ‘13

Regulus had no right to give. Not being a member of the senate,
as having suffered capitis deminutio, he could not give his sententia
as a senator in his place. This is possibly a little too subtle.

46. auctor, an ‘adviser', ‘ supporter’3 then also ‘originator'.

46. nunquam alias dato, ‘ never given on any other occasion ’‚
not by Regulus only, but by any man.

48. egregius exsul, an oxymoron, a seeming contradiction, but
full of the highest meaning. As an exile he was degraded 3 yet his
courage gave him the highest distinction.

49, 50. The story of the torture inflieted upon Regulus after his
return to Carthage seems to be of doubtful authority. Polybius, who
lived nearest to the time, makes no mention of it. Cicero, however,
tells it at length. Dio Cassius gives it as a tradition. A story is
also told of Marcia, wife of Regulus, as having caused Carthaginian

Eriszneisss t} be ill-treated in revenge for the cruelties practised on
er us an .

52. reditus, the plural is used to avoid the assonance as well as
the ambiguity that would result from using the singular.

53. quam si, to be taken with non aliter.

54. diiudicata lite, it is better to take this as meaning decided
by the courts‚ not as decided by himself as arbitrator. The Roman
noble acted as patronus or advocate for his clients. A survival of
this practice still exists in our own conventional rule that an advocate
cannot recover his fees. He is supposed to give his services gratui-
tously as the Roman noble did.

C 55. Venafrum, famous sor its olive-yards‚ was a town of N orthern
ampama.

56. Lacedaemonium Tarentum, founded by the Spartan Phalan-
thus. “Re nata quondam rura Laconi.” Observe the studiously
quiet tone o this ending of a poem full of high-wrought rhetoric.

XVII.

The poet complains of tlte indtjfference and impiety qf tlte age. To
this it owes its reverses and disasters. Jts morality is sapped3 tlte
rising generation is infected witlz vice, and degenerates from the purity
and sels-control qs earlier times.

Augustus was a restorer of temples, and he endeavoured to reform
the public morals by legislation.

1. immeritus, cf. XII. 4. The virgines puerique, to whom Horace
is addressing himself, could not be held responsible for the sins which
were bringing ruin on the State3 nevertheless they would suffer for
them unless they could avert the divine wrath.
