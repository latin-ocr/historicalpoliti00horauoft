18 ODES OF γ HORACE.

of literary probability, we may say that II. may *well have
been written after 1., but not Ι. after 11. Epode iv. (marked
ΙΙΙ.) is a bitter invective against some upstart of servile origin
who had been promoted to equestrian rank, and who was
flaunting his new honours in the face of an indignant city.
It contains a clear allusion to Sex· Pompeius. ‘ What is the
good', asks the poet, ‘of fitting out great fleets against the
pirates and runaway slaves ’—just the terms in which Pom-
peius' followers would be spoken of in Rome—‘ when such
a fellow as this is made a tribune?’ The object offthe attack
is said by the Scholiasts to have been Menas or Menodorus,
a trusted friend of Pompeius, who in 38 betrayed a squad-
ron which he commanded and the island of Sardinia to
Augustus. This is not probable; for Menas must have been
in some favour in Rome, really despised, no doubt, by those
whom he had served by his treachery, but still safe against
open attack of this kind. This, however, does not concern
our present purpose. Extract III. may be conjecturally
ascribed to 38, when the Treaty of Misenum had broken
down, and before the defeat of Pompeius in 36.

These three poems, then, must be put in a class by them-
selves. The writer of them is clearly not yet ‘reconciled’.
He despairs of the state; he does not recognize anywhere
the men who are to save it. It can hardly be supposed,
therefore, that they can be the verses which were to win
powerful friends for their writer. These are probably to be
found in the earlier Satires or even in some of the Odes.

Published later, and after receiving the corrections suggested ’

by a more mature taste‚ these may have been first written in
the early days of Horace’s residence in Rome, and may have
proved to Maecenas, even when less perfect in form than now,
that a new poet worthy of his patronage had been found.

In 36, as has been said, Sex. Pompeius was defeated.
Maecenas took part in the expedition which ended in this
result. It has been argued that Epode i. (IV.) belongs to
this period. Another theory refers it to some time before
the battle of Actium. Maecenas did not, as a matter os fact,
’ take any part in the Actium campaign, bu't remained in
