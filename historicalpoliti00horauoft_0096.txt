92 ODES OF HORACE.

populos”. Seneca contrasts the “ maritam ulmum ” with the
“sterilem platanum”. Caelebs is always used os an unmarried male,
but in the union between the vine and the tree the vine is the male;
its use here is therefore exceptional.

5. evincet, ‘will drive out’3 cf. our word ‘ eviction’.

6. copia narium, ‘all the wealth of the nostrils' is the literal
rendering of this phrase. This might mean ‘all that the nostrils
could have sor their enjoyment'; possibly nares may be used for the
sweet scents which minister to the sense of smell.

7, 8. odorem and fertilibus are contrasted by being put close
together. ‘ These flowers will scatter sragrance over the olive-yards
which brought a more substantial return to their former possessor.'

9. laurea3 sc. arboszlaurus.

10. ictus fervidos, ‘fiery darts' of the sun. Cf. our word, ‘sun-
stroke’. So Lucretius has the phrases verbera solis and tela diei, &e.
So Tennyson, “the scarlet shafts of sunrise”, though this is used of
the form rather than the force of the rays.

·11. praescriptum, ‘ordered’.

12. intonsi Catonis; the younger Scipio is said to have first set
the fashion os shaving daily. He was a younger contemporary of
the elder Cato (Cato 234—1493 Scipio 185-129). Cato represented
the conservative, Scipio the reforming party in both political and
social matters. Ovid (Fasti, vi. 263) has “hie erat intonsi regia
magna N umae'’.

12. auspiciis, ‘ by the example' or ‘ guidance’. It is a metaphor
from military customs. The general in command of an army took
the ‘auspices’‚ zze. obtained the sanction os the divine powers sor
his proceedings. Auspicia therefore is equivalent to ‘guidance’‚
‘ leadership’.

13. εει-15115, the result of the assessment made on all citizens
(censeo), i.e. ‘income'.

14. commune, ‘the revenue':r?› κοινόν.

14. decempedis, the decempeda was a standard Roman measure,
coming between the passus (nearly 5 ft.) and the actus (between 116
and 117 ft.). It was otherwise called pertica, i.e. ‘ pole‘. It differs
from ‘ten seet’ English measure by 3.504 inches, i.e. ten times the
difference between the Roman foot and the English, the former
being 11.6496 inches.

15, 16. opacam excipiebat Arcton. Arcton here is com-
monly translated ‘ north wind’. The word in itsels might well bear
this meaning; septemtriones is so used. But opacam gdoes not suit
this sense. A wind could not be called opacus, except possibly as
the S.W. wind (Notus) is called albus, as clearing the sky (Odes
1. vii. 15). But there is no question of this here. The poet’s idea
