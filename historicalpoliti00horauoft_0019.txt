*⁸⁸ Romae nutriri mihi contigit atque doceri
iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles
adiecere bonae paulo plus artis Athenae.
scilicet ut vellem curvo dinoscere rectum,
atque inter silvas academi quaerere verum.
dura sed emovere loco me tempora grato,
civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in arma
Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis,
unde simul primum me dimisere Philippi,

We naturally ask, What where these verses which the pres-
sure of poverty drove the young clerk to write, by which he
hoped to obtain money or friends? Can we recognize them
in anything of his that survives? Before we attempt to
“ answer these questions, it will be well to sketch the course of
events between the battle of Philippi (42) and the last meet-
ing of Antony and Augustus at Brundisium (37).

In 41 occurred what is called the Perusine War. Early in
that year Octavius set about the task of dividing the confis-
cated lands among the veterans of the victorious army. It
was an ungrateful business, raising hatred among the dis-

his time in Egypt with Cleopatra, had acted with energy,

what hurt the wrath os Achilles wrought the Greeks. Kindly Athens added a
little more culture, making me wish at last to distinguish the right from the
wrong and to seek for truth amid the groves os the Aeademy. But from that
pleasant place the eruel times bore me off, and the tide of civil strise oerried
me, all ignorant of war, to the armies that were no match sor the mighty them
os caesar Augustus. As soon as Philippi gave me my discharge, crawliug low
with wings close cut, suipped of my inheritance os home and sarm, bold poverty
drove me into making verse.
