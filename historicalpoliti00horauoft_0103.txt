sor death ’. The magnae animae (Tac. Agr-ic. xlvii.) sor whom philo-
sophers reserved immortality. Those who believed in a future lise

23. coetus=coitus, a ‘gathering'‚ ‘herd’.

23. udam, ‘moist', ‘ misty’, opposed to liquidus aether (Wick-
ham).

25. The poet dwells on the idea of the few deserving as opposed to
the many undeserving (πολλοί τοι ναρθηκοφόροι, Βάκχοι δέ γε παῦροι).
The privileged must remember this, and-not vulgarise their gifts.

c.

29. phaselon, see IX. 21 (note).

29. Diespiter, an archaic word, possibly used in invocations and
other ceremonials.

3ο. incesto, ‘unholy'=parum castus.

X IV.

The man who is firm in righteous purpose is undismrbed by all
