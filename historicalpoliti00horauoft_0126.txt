122 ODES OF HORACE.

35. nefastiznefandi or nefarii. The word is commonly used oi
unlawful days in the calendar.

36. unde, ‘from what?'

37, 38. metu pEpercit, a singular license3 the iambic is rare in
the first foot of the Alcaie, but here is found in two successive lines.

38-40. ‘Would that thou wouldst forge again on a hard auvil
against the Scythian and the Arab our now blunted swords Ξ ’

XX.

The poet sings first ol the gods, of Jupiter, chief of all and incom-
parably great, of Pallas next in place, then of demi-gods, then of the
old heroes of Rome, and aster them of the young hope of the state,

Marcellus. F inally he comes back to the praises of Jupiter and oi -

Caesar, his vicegerent on earth.
1. The beginning is adapted from Pindar (Olymp. 2)—

ἀναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι
τίνα θεόν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομεν;

1, 2. acri tibia, cf. XVIII. 1.

2. sumis celebrare, one of Horace's extensions of the use of the
infinitive. If this mood is regarded as a substantive, we may say
that it is the object of sumis, while in its verbal character it governs
virum, &c., ‘the celebrating of what man, &c.‚ dost thou take to
thyself ?‘ Page regards sumis as an extension of the idea of wishing.

4. imago, ‘echo '‚ i.e. of vocis, understood.

5, 6. Helicon (in Boeotia), the abode of the Muses, as was
girrffilizsugin Thessaly), while Haemus (in Thrace) was identified with

7. temere, in wild haste.
9. materna, because he was the son of Calliope.

11, 12. blandum ducere. There is an idea os power in the
word blandus, which may account for the infinitive that follows it.

11. auritas. As an animal when miraculously endowed with
speech is said to become vocalis, as Tibullus (11. v. 78) has “vocales
praemonuisse boves '’, so a tree when similarly endowed with hearing

may be called aurita.

13. parentis, the “sator hominumque deumque'h The various
reading parentum is hardly worth discussing.

14. Cf. Verg. (Aen. i. 230), “O qui res hominumque deumque Ι
aeternis regis imperiis ”.

16. horis, ‘seasons ’, as the Greek ὤραι.
