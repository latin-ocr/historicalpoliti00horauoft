probability that they inclined to republicanism. Students‚
with the curious exception os our own university youth, are
commonly among the fiercest partisans of freedom ; at
Athens certainly all the associations of the place, historical
and literary, were hostile to personal rule. However this
may have been, the young Horace certainly gave in his ad-
hesion to the republican cause. In September, 44„ M. Brutus
visited Athens. Whether he was in want of young Officers,
- though the golden youth of Rome, sons of the great senatorial
families, were on his side, or was attracted by some charm
in the poet’s personality—-Brutus, it will be remembered, had
strong literary tastes—it is certain that he offered him a
tribuneship in the republican army. N ominally this was a
high command, giving the holder a right, shared with his
five colleagues of the same rank, to command the legion. As
a matter of fact, it was little more than an honorary post.
Young men of good birth or fortune commonly received the
promotion after a very brief military experience‚ sometimes
without any experience at all. The officer really in charge
was some veteran centurion, who was supposed to take his
orders from the young tribune, but really suggested them.
Horace left Athens in the company of his patron. We may
conclude that he was, for a time at least, in personal attend-
ance on him, for he describes, with the air of having been an
eye-witness, the trial of a suit in which Brutus sat as judge.
He speaks of himself as having seen some sharp fighting, as
having been, along with the old comrade whom he is ad-
dressing, “often brought to the last extremity'' (ΙΧ.). Where
this may have happened we cannot say, possibly in Thrace,
where Brutus sought to relieve his desperate want os means
by plundering the native tribes, a warlike population which
was not likely to submit quietly to such exactions.

While the republican leaders were conducting their oper-
ations in a somewhat aimless fashion, a powerful coalition
was formed at Rome. M. Antonius, C. Octavius, great-
nepheW, adopted son, and heir of Caesar, and Lepidus, a
third, who played the part of Crassus, combined their powers.
A vote of the people appointed them ‘commissioners sor
