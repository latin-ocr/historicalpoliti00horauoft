94 ODES OF HORACE.

he addresses himself to the new generation. Possibly—and indeed
the idea is of a kindred nature—it may mean that these carmina are
fit for innocent ears, the sense in which the words virginibus puer-
isque are now commonly used.

With the whole passage compare Epp. 1. xix. 32—

“Hunc ego, non alio dictum prius ore, Latinus
volgavi fidicen; iuvat immemorata serentem
ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri'’.

5. proprios grege's, the king is in Homer ποιμὴν λαῶν. Proprius
expresses either the king's ownership of his people or grex (a signi·
fication which would emphasize the use of rex as a ‘ despot', and so
hatesul to Roman ears), or the limitation of his power to his own
people, as opposed to the universal sway of Jupiter. This seems to
me preferable3 ‘imperium est' must be supplied from the next line
before “ in proprios greges'’.

8. supercilio, super-cilium, i.e. ‘above the eye-lid'‚ or ‘that
gigig? ἳῗηὶεὲὲεέ-(ξείο, καλύπτω); in other words the ‘eye-brow'. So

ἦ καὶ κυανέῃσιν ἐπ’ ὀφρύσι νεῦσε Κρονίων
. . μέγαν δ’ ἐλέλιξεν Ὀλύμπου.

9. est ut, ‘it is possible that', ‘it may be that'.

9, 10. ordinet arbusta sulcis; the arbusta are the ‘trees' on
which, in Italian fashion, the vines are trained. These, when the
vineyard was formed, were regularly planted in ranks that resembled
military orders. So Virgil, Georg. ii. 277, “indulge ordinibus '',
where the poet draws o‘ut the military comparison at length.

11. descendat. This was literally true, as the Campus (Martius),
where the elections were held, was low ground (near the Tiber), to
which it was necessary to come down from the hills. Cf. I. 7. ’ The
word is also used generally of those engaging in conflict. So Suet.
Aug. 96, os Augustus, “apud Actium descendenti in aciem”.

11. petitor. There were still, in theory, candidates, and the
elections were held in the Campus (Tiberius transferred them to the
senate). But the whole thing was a sham. The language of Horace,
however, would please Augustus, who loved to pose as the restorer
of the Republic3 and indeed a certain freedom of choice, as there
were certainly more candidates than offices, was allowed.

12. moribus, fama, ‘character', ‘repute', opposed to the high
birth expressed by generosior.

14. aequa, ‘impartial'.
14. Necessitastatum.

15. sortitur, ‘ puts to the hazard of the lot'. -
Destiny is pictured shaking the urn (literally the um itself shakes),
in which are the lots with names written upon them. In an election
