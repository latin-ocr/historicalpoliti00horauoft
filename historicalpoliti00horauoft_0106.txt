102 ODES OF HORACE.

20. mulier peregrina, ‘the alien woman ', whom ‘the goddess
does not condescend to name.

20, 21. vertit in pulverem, ‘overthrew into '‚ or ‘laid low in the
dust', seems better than Wickham's ‘ reduced to dust’

21. ex quo (tempore) follows damnatum.

21. destituit. Cicero has (pro Rosc. Amer. xl.) “decepit, de-
stituit ’', as nearly synonymous.

22. mercede pacta, better taken as an ablative after destituit
(equivalent to a word of ‘ depriving ‘) than as absolute.

22. Laomedon desrauded Neptune and Apollo of the wages
which he had promised to pay them sor building the walls of Troy.

22. mihi, by me, aster damnatum.
24. duce, i.e. Laomedon, not Priam.

25. adulterae, the genitive aster hospes rather than the dative
after splendet, ‘decks himself out for’. It would be harsh to speak
of Paris as a hospes, a guest, without a qualifying word to show whose
guest he had been.

25. ερΙεῐιᾱεῒ--κάλλεί τε στίλβων καὶ εἵμασιν.

28. Hectoreis opibus. The singular ope would oe more usual
than the plural to express by Hector’s help. For the services os
Hector, cf. Verg. Aen. ii. 291—2, “si Pergama dextra Ι defendi pos-
sent etiam hac defensa fuissent ‘'.

28. refringit, ⁴ shatters ’, ‘ repulses '.
29. ductum :productum, ‘ protracted '.

29. seditionibus, ‘quarrels', ‘factions’. Seditio is literally a
‘going apart ’.

30. resedit, ‘has settled down ⁵, i.e. come to an end.

30. protinus, ‘forthwith', ‘from this hour'.

31. nepotem, ‘grandson ', because son of Juno's own son, who
was Mars.

32. “Juno will not name Rhea Silvia (see note on lines 19, 20).
There is probably additional scorn in the close conjunction of
⁴ peperit '—-‘ sacerdos ' (za vestal).’' (Wickham.)

33. redonabo. Page, following Nauck, explains this word as ‘ Ι
will give up’, the re as in reddo expressing the payment of some-
thing due. Orelli, followed by Marshall and Wickham, makes it
equal to condonabo. This seems to suit better with iras than does
the other meaning. There must, however, be “a slight zeugma
involved’¹, as Marshall remarks, “in the use of the word both with
iras and nepotem '‘.

33. illurn ege. The juxtaposition is emphatic. ‘Such as he
is, such as I am.'
