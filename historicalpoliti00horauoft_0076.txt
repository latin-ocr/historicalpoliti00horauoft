For the object of this attack see Introduction, p. 18. It may have
been a certain Vedius Rufus, otherwise unknown, who is mentioned
in the heading of the Epode, as given in some MSS. “Vedium
Rufum ex servitute miratur usurpasse dignitatern equestrem usque ad
tribunatum militurn.’'

lx. sgrtitozsorle, by lot, i.e. sate. For the form compare con-

3. Ibericis funibus, ‘ropes of Spanish broom ⁷, a very tenacious

3. latuS, an accusative of respect, as is crura in line 4.
5. ambules, ‘strut’; the word suggests a haughty gait.

construction.

8. ulna, the fore-arm from the shoulder to the wrist (ὠλένη),

ordinary breadth of a toga was, but the ordinary loose surplice (as
distinguished from the short close-fitting alb) measures seven or
eight feet. In the Pro Cluentio (c. 40) Cicero ridicules the extra-
vagantly long robe of a foppish official (“usque ad talos demissam

purpuram '').

first-class vineyard would be a very valuable possession.

14. mannis, horses srom Gaul, ‘cobs', famous sor their speed.
