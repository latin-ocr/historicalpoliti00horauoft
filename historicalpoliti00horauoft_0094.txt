90 ODES OF HORACE.

troops, &c., though, as Wickham well remarks, this suits the pre-
ceding stanza better than the other sense. But to ‘ hear of’ must be
understood of lines 23, 24, and it is better to take a sense which will
suit both divisions of the stanzas. Page pertinently observes that
the addition of the phrase non indecoro pulvere sordidos pre-
eludes this interpretation: “it is as absurd to say ‘1 hear great
leaders begrimed', &c., as it would be to say ‘ I heard Mr. Gladstone
in evening dress '. '' It may be added that generals harangued their
troops bessare an action, and that they are pulvere sordidi whether
indecoro or non indecoro aster it.

24. atrocem, ‘ stubborn'. Silius, pun. xiii. 369, “atrox virtus'',
and vi. 369, “cognita et olim Ι atrox illa fides” of Regulus. Cf.
XX. 35, “ Catonis nobile letum''.

For gods leaving a conquered city or country, cf. Verg. Aen. ii.
352— “ Excessere omnes adytis arisque relicti
Di quibus imperium hoc steterat’'.

Rome.
29. pinguior, cf. Verg. Georg. i. 491—
“ N ec fuit indignum superis bis sanguine nostro
Emathiam et latos Haemi pinguescere campos''.
30. impia, cf. II. 9. ,
31. Medis, i.e. Persae and so Parthians.

35, 36. Page well remarks: “ Note the assonanee of these lines and
the powerful effect produced by the repetition of the vowel ‘ o', and
the combination ‘or'. The peculiar rhythm os line 36 adds to the
effect. Before breaking off from his warlike theme Horace seems
to desire to show by the very sound and shape of his verse how dis·
