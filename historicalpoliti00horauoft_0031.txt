INTRODUCTION. 27

in the oracles of which they had charge, and the court
antiquarians discovered that similar celebrations had taken
place in the years 436, 326, 126. Even then the Emperor
anticipated ,the correct date, but the variation was justified
by the statement that the rite was held in the last year of the
old seculum, rather than in the first year of the neW. Part
os the celebration was the singing of a hymn to the two
deities‚ and Horace, as the Poet Laureate of the day, was
charged with the duty of writing it.¹

The ten years between 23 and 13 had brought considerable
changes. The imperial power had been still further con-
solidated. The Roman world, in general, accepted as a
necessity the concentration os power in the hands of a single
ruler. External affairs were, on the whole, prosperous. The
Parthian King had given back (20 Rc.) the standards lost
by the army of Crassus, and so far the disgrace of the defeat
had been obliterated, though it was not by any means true,
as stated in the flattering words of the court poets‚ that
these standards had been recovered by force of arms. The
Cantabrian tribes in Northern Spain, which had long resisted
the armies of Rome, had been subdued by Agrippa. This
was in the year 19.

In the year 17 Lollius indeed was de1eated by the
Sygambri, a German tribe which had invaded Gallia
Belgica, and Augustus had thought it necessary to proceed
in person to Gaul. The prestige of Rome was restored by
himself and his lieutenants, and when he returned to Rome
in 13 the frontiers os the Empire were undisturbed. Mean-

¹An interesting discovery was made in 1890, in connection with the Carmen
Seculare. In the Campus Martius between the Bridge of S. Angelo and the
Church os S. Giovanni de' Fiorentini were found fragments of two columns,
which had been set up to commemorate the celebration of the Ludi Seculares
on two ocoesions—by Augustus in 17 B.c., and by Septimius Severus and his
sons in ΛΑ). 20⁴· The inscription on the column os Augustus gives a list os the
various sacrifices and festivities that took place on the occasion, and records the
singing of the Carmen. This was done, it tells 115, twice, for the first time on
the way from the Temple os Apollo on the Palatine Hiu to the Capitol, and for
the second on the way back. The cheir consisted of 27 boys and as many girls.
There was an orchestral accompaniment. The inscription adds:
