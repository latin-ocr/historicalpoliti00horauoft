lation is told by Livy, i. 16, and Ovid, Fasti, ii. 495, “ Hinc tonat,

The reason for the earnest dissuasion that follows against a sup·
posed plan of rebuilding Troy presents a problem sor which there
does not appear to be any solution. It seems too serious to be an
omamental digression. On the other hand, could there ever have
been any need sor these dissuasions? It is true that Suetonius at-
tributes toJulius Caesar an intention os making Alexandria or Novum
Ilium the capital of the empire. But no one has ever credited
Augustus with such design, which indeed seems wholly inconsistent
with his zealous efforts to glorify the associations of Rome. Page
quotes with a-pproval as “a reasonable solution ” Pliiss’s explana-
tion that the poet wishes to enforce upon his countrymen two lessons:
‘⁸ that (1) they must look upon empire as a roeponsibility and not as
a means os self-enrichment; (2) they must not imagine that they can
restore that which has been doomed to destruction, i.e. apart from
symbolism, they must give up the old republic and accept the new
monarchy as the divinely-appointed condition of the continuance os
Rome'’. It must be remembered that something like that which the
poet deprecates did actually happen three centuries and a half later.
But perhaps it will be sufficient to say that the poet seizes an oppor-
tunity of introducing a splendid panegyric on the greatness os Rome. ¹
Among the mortals whose virtues have won sor them the honours
of immortality is Quirinus, the deified founder of Rome. He, like
two of his compecm, Bacchus and Hercules, has had to overcome
the jealousy of the queen of heaven. This jealousy she is repre-
sented as solemnly renouncing. She forgets her personal wrongs
and her resentment against a perjured race. The children of the
scion of Troy shall rule the world. Still she must be consistent.
The doom of Troy itself must never be reversed.

17. consiliantibus. Seneca, in his pungent satire on Claudius
(Apocolocyntosis), introduces the gods deliberating whether they
shall admit the new claimant for Olympian honours,

18. Ilion, Ilion, “it was Troy that I hated, and Troy is de·
stroyed”. (Wickham.)

19. fatalis, ‘tool of destiny'.

19. incestus, cf. XIII. 30. The two adjectives express between
them the whole action of fate. Troy was doomed, but the doom
was brought about by unrighteousness.

19. iudex. The reference is to the judgment of Paris when he
gave the prize of beauty to Aphrodite. The story is post-flemene,
the passage in ll. xxiv. being in all probability spurious.
