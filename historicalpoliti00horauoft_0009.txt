PREFACE.

 

In the second volume of the Classical Review are some
highly interesting papers by Dr. Theobald Ziegler‚ professor
in the University of Strasbourg, on “Classical Education in
Germany’'. ln one of these Professor Ziegler remarks: “Of
course, a good teacher does not take them (the Odes of
Horace) in Horace's order, but arranges them according to
their contents ”. I must confess that I had read the Odes with
my classes at school and college for many years without so
arranging them, and that I had not even heard of any such
method being followed. It would indeed have been often
impossible to do so, because the portions set for examination
always consist of one or more of the Books.

Of course this fact has been a practical difficulty in the
way of carrying out the idea which Professor Ziegler's words
at once suggested to me, and which at last has found shape
in this volume. Doubt has been expressed whether, in view
of the common practice of examining bodies, a place would
be found for such a book. Horace, however, is not always
read, even in schools, for examination purposes. There is
a manifest advantage in bringing together whatever of his
poetry bears upon the profoundly interesting subject of
Roman history. Another advantage, not less important,
is to be found in the fact that we can here present to the
young reader some of Horace’s noblest thought and ex-
pression without any admixture of the frivolous or base.

Ι have had before me in putting together my Notes the
editions of Orelli, Marshall, Wickham, and Page. To these
1 wish to make a general acknowledgment. Special obliga-
tions 1 have endeavoured to notice where thev occur.
