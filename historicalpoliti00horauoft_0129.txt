51, 52. Cf. Ovid, Met. xv. 858-60—

“ Iuppiter arces
temperat aethereas, et mundi regna triformis;
terra sub Augusto ; pater est et rector uterque ''.

51. secundo, cf. the note on lines 18—19. It is impossible to

54. Cf. XVIII. 9-16.
54. egerit, ‘ driven' or ‘led before him ².

54. iusto triumpho, ‘well-earned triumph '. “Agere trium-
phum” is used for ‘to celebrate a triumph'‚ but ducere of the pri-
soners, &c., who formed part of the procession. If we could take
triumphus as=victoria (a very rare usage), the difficulty (the use of
egerit instead of duxerit) would disappear, and domitos would belong
strictly to triumpho, as its place seems to indicate. ‘ He shall have
driven before him the Parthi, vanquished in a complete victory.’
Iusta is applied to victoria in this sense as to proelium. So Cicero
(Epp. ad Diversos, ii. 10), “ victoria iusta imperator appellatus''.

55. subiectos, ‘ bordering', perhaps with the idea of being directly
beneath the sun.

56. Seras, used vaguely for the extreme East.

57. te minor, emphatic, ‘ ever subordinate to thee ’.
57. aequus combines the idea of equity and protection.
59. parum castis, ‘polluted'.

XXI.

An Ode in raise of Drusus, younger son of Livia, and so stepson
of Augustus, or his victories over the Raeti. The poet introduces
a compliment to Augustus, and then digresses to celebrate the achieve-
ments of an ancestral hero, who had won the great battle of Metaurus.

1—18. The subject of this long sentence is Raeti, in line 17, the
verb videre, the object Drusum, in line 18. The Raeti saw
Drusus, such by birth and breeding as is the young eagle (whose
growth is described in lines 1-12), and with such feelings as the fawn
of a roe-decr sees a young lion.

1. Qualem, governed (1) by propulit, which follows the subjeets
iuventas and vigor3 (2) by docuere following venti; (3) by de-
misit following impetus; and (4) by egit following amor. (1) It
leaves its nest, (2) it learns to fly, (3) it attacks the sheep-folds, (4)
it challenges snakes.
