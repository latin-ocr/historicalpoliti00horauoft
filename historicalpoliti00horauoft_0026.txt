22 ODES OF HORACE.

its anger at the murder of Caesar. He asks where a remedy
for the troubles of the State is to be found. Will Venus, or
Mars, or Apollo help the imperilled Empire? Finally it is
to Augustus, in whom he recognizes a divine visitant con-
descending to dwell awhile on earth, that he turns.1 The

1 It will be interesting to compare with this ode the invocation of Augustus
which we find in the First Georgic, an invooetion still more extravagant in
language. It was read to Augustus in the year 29, immediately aster his return
to Italy. After appealing to Bacchus and Ceres, to the Fauns and Dryads, to
Pan and Minerva, all the gods and goddesses that cared for rural things, that
caused the crops to grow and the rain to fall, he goes on—

“Tuque adeo, quem mox quae sint habitura deorum
concilia incertum est, urbisne invisere, Caesar,
terrarumve velis curam, et te maximus orbis
auctorem frugum tempestatumque potentem
accipiat, cingens materna tempora myrto,
an deus immensi venias maris ac tua nautae
numina sola colant, tibi serviat ultima Thule,
teque sibi generum Tethys emat omnibus undis:
anne novum tardis sidus te mensibus addas,
qua locus Erigonen inter Chelasque sequentis
panditur: ipse tibi iam bracchia contrahit ardens
Scorpios, et caeli iusta plus parte reliquit:
quidquid eris,—nam te nec sperant Tartara regem
nec tibi regnandi veniat tam dira cupido:
quamvis Elysios miretur Graecia campos,
nec repetita sequi curet Proserpina matrem—
da facilem cursum, atque audacibus adnue coeptis,

· ignarosque viae mecum miseratus agrestis
ingredere, et votis iam'nunc adsuesce voca-5¹¹.

“ Thou, Caesar, chief, where’er thy choice ordain,
To fix 'mid gods thy yet unchosen reign—
Wilt thou o‘er cities stretch thy guardian sway,
While earth, and all her realms thy nod obey?
The world's vast orb shall own thy genial power}
Giver of sruits, fair sun, and savonring shower;
Before thy altar grateful nations bow,
And with maternal myrtle wreath thy brow-
O'er boundless ocean shall thy power prevai1‚
Thee her sole lord the world of waters hailr
Rule, where the sea remotest Thule laves,
While Tethys dowers thy bride with all her νινε-,ετ
wilt thou 'mid Scorpius and the Virgin rise,
And, a new star, illume thy native skies?
Scorpius, e'en now, each shrinking claw confines,
And more than half his heaven to thee resigns.
