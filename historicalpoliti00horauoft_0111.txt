NOTEs. 107

38. abdidit seems preferable to addidit, there being MS. authority
sor both (reddidit is clearly a correction). Addidit is supported by
a passage in Tacitus (Ann. xiii. 31), “coloniae Capua atque Nuceria
additis veteranis firmatae sunt ’'. This, however, is taking a differ·
ent point of view; something done for the benefit of the colonies.
Abdidit has better support in the passage (Epp. 1. 1. 5), “ Veianius
armis 1 Herculis ad postem fixis latet abditus agro”. Orelli, however,
reads addidit, thinking that there is “nescio quid inglorii et prope
ignominiosi” in the alternative.

40. See Appendix C.

41. lene consilium, ‘mild counsels', such as that which was
carried out in the clemency which the poet celebrates in IX. The
word is treated as trisyllabic: consilium, the first ‘ i’ being lengthened
by the combination os the second ‘ i ’ with the final syllable.

41. dato implies acceptance; otherwise the giver would feel no
pleasnre in it.

42. almae, ‘kindly powers'.

43. Titanas immanemque turmam, ‘the monstrous host of
Titans’. Strictly speaking the Titans are to be distinguished from
{ffiggonStrous shapes as Typhoeus with the hundred hands, and

44. sustulerit, ‘swept away’.
44. caduco, ‘down-darting', καταιβάτης κεραυνός.

45. terram inertem, “bruta tellus’' (Odes 1. xxxiv. 9), the ‘un-
moving earth'.

46. regna tristia, ‘the realms os woe’, i.e. dwellings of the dead,
as contrasted with the cities of the living. Each part os the great
dominion has its appropriate epithet, and all, as Wickham says, are
“ such as imply some difficulty or unlikelihood in the way of his rule.
He can sway the marth, however insensate it be; the sea, however

governs terram and mare, regit the other objects.

48. imperio unus aequo, ‘sole ruler with impartial sway', or,
perhaps, ‘kindly’.

49. It has been pointed out that what follows is inconsistent with
the preceding. The calm, almighty ruler of 45—8 appears to have
been terrified. It is the resolution of inferior deities that keeps him
on his throne. The poet wishes to magnify the might of intellect as
personified in Pallas, and the mention of Pallas leads on to a pietur-

was to be seen on the tympanum of the pediment in the Pantheon of
of M. Agrippa (completed in B.c. 27).
