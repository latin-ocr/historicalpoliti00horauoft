ranged side by side with the Latins. Some of its citizens had been
admitted to the full citizenship of Rome, and all to civitas sine
suffragio. The irritation caused by its defection was very great, and
when compelled to surrender (3.0. 211) it was treated with great
severity. Many of the upper class were put to death, many of the
lower sold into slavery. Plautus, in the T rz'nummus (probably pro-
duced twenty years after this event), levels a savage taunt at the
endurance of the Campanian slaves,

“ Campans genus
multo Surorum iani antidit patientiam” (545-6).

5. Spartacus, a gladiator (a Thracian by birth) who, at the
head of an army of gladiators and runaway slaves, held out for more
than two years (Β. C. 73—71) against all the power of Rome.

6. novis rebus must be ablative and equivalent to inter novas res,
‘in the midst of revolution'. So Orelli. Wickham takes it as a
dative, and translates “ faithless ally of revolution’' in reference to
the part which the envoys of the Allobroges played in betraying the
advances of the Catilinarian conspirators to them. But this cer-
tainly diminished rather than aggravated the danger of Rome. The
reference is more general. Disloyal subjects were an additional peril
when revolution was about. Possibly there is a reference to the
attack made by the Allobroges on the Roman province of Gallia
Narbonensis some little time aster the Catiline troubles. They
were defeated by its governor, C. Pompeius, the very man who as
praetor had arrested their envoys two years before. Α The Allobroges
were settled east of the Rhone.

7. caerulea, blue-eyed. Tacitus (Germ. 4) says “ omnibus
truces et caerulei oculi, rutilae comae, magna corpora’' .

7. Germania. The reference is to the invasion of the Cimbri
and Teutones, finally crushed‚ after various disastrous defeats of
Roman armies, by C. Marius, at the Campi Raudii (probably Robbio
between Vercelli and Mortara in the Lombard Plains).

8. parentibus, ‘parents’‚ i.e. fathers and mothers, not, as Orelli
takes it, ‘our ancestors', i.e. equivalent to maioribus„ Cf. Odes, 1. i.
24, “ bella matribus detestata’ .

8. abominatus, passive. Orelli quotes Livy, xxxi. 12, “abom-
inati-gerfrimmes’ss and from Priscian, “saevitia abominaretur ab
omni us .

9. impia, an epithet frequently applied to civil war.

9. devoti sanguinis is a descriptive genitive, going with aetas,
“a generation which inherits a curse'’.

10. rursus, again, as before Rome was built.

11. insistet, followed by the accusative cineres, an uncommon
construction, but found in Aen. vi. 563, “nulli fas casto sceleratum
insistere limen ” .
