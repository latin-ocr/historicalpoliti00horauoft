98 omas OF HORACE.

9. rudis agminum, unskilled in battle, possibly contrasted‚ as
{lgssffiu suggests, with the warlike experience of the young

10. sponsus regius. Orelli instances Coroebus (Verg. Aen. ii.
341), who had come to Troy to win the hand of the Princess Cass-

andra.

uli’tacm depends upon asperum, ‘savage’‚ i.e. ‘dangerous to
touc .

11. cruenta, ¹ bloodthirsty', or ‘ cruel'.

13. Perhaps the poet's reason for the necessity of daring in the
young soldier, perhaps an expression of the soldier’s own feeling.

14. mors carries on the meaning of mori. Cf. Tyrt. vii. 1—

τεθνάμεναι ’γὰρ καλὸν ἐνὶ προμάχοισι πεσόντα
ἄνδρ’ ά-γαθόν, περὶ ᾔ πατρίδι μαρνάμενον.

14. persequitur, ‘follows hard after'.
16. poplitibus, ‘the ham ’ or ‘ back of the knee'.

17. virtus, translate ‘virtue’. It is the independence of the
citizen. Horace passes from the qualifications of the soldier to
those of the civilian. In doing so he takes up sornething of the Stoic
strain. His ideal citizen is the wise man, the sapiens, whose honours
do not depend on the breath of popular favour, who is, in virtue of
his wisdom, a king, or, to use language more agreeable to Roman
ears, consul or any other popular magistrate. Cf. Odes IV. ix. 39,

‘consulque non unius anni 1 sed quoties bonus atque fidus Ι iudex

honestum praetulit utili ’'.
17. repulsae, the technical word for defeat at the polls.

17. sordidus has also political associafions, suggesting the mourn-

taminatus occurs in Livy and Varro.

18. honoribuS, the usual word sor magistracies.

19. secures These were the axes, symbols os power, carried
in the midst of the fasces by the lictors who walked before the magis-
trates. In the city, indeed, fasces were without the secures, because
military rule did not prevail there. For other particulars see Dic-

tionary of A ntiquities‚ sub v.
20. arbitrio, ‘by the judgment’.

20. popularis aurae, ‘the breath of popular favour’. So Vei-g.
Aen. vi. 817 of Ancus Martiusf ‘nunc quoque iam nimium gaudens
popularibus auris’ ’,though the application is somewhat different.
Cicero (Pro Cluentio, xlvii.),‘ ‘ventum quendam popularem” .

21. immeritis mori, ‘who did not desei-ve to die’, ‘too good
