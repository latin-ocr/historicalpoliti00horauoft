134 oDEs or HORACE.

followed by a preposition, or simple case. Page says, “Perhaps
Horace purposely uses a phrase which suggests both ideas'’

1. Romulae- Romuleae, for the convenience os metre.

4. sancto concilio. So Cic. Cat. ii. 4, “orbis terrae sanctissi-
mum gravissimumque concilium '’, of the Senate.

5. So Aeschyl. Persae, 300-1, Atossa, speaking of the return of
xerxes— ἐμοῖς μὲν εἶπας δώμασιν φάος μέγα
καὶ λευκὸν ἦμαρ νυκτὸς ἐκ μελαγχίμου.

6. instar, an indecl. substantive, is used very much as our word
‘like' is used, i. e. somewhat ungrammatically.

7. gratior it, ‘passes in mole delightful sash1on'. Comp. for
this the lover’s language in Verg. Ecl. vii. 59, ‘Phyllidis adventu
nostrae nemus omne virebit'’

9—14. mater is subject of vocat. Cf. Odes 111. vii.‚ where a wife
is lamenting the absence of her husband, kept during the winter in
Oricus (a harbour in Epirus, and so E. of Italy). The Carpathian
Sea (see xix. 6) was still more so. The S.W. wind (Notus) would
be unsavourable in either case. All sailing, indeed, was at an end
between early in November and late in March.

11. spatio annu0=‘ ‘the sailing time of one year’ '(Wickham)‚

“the space yearly available for navigation’' (Page). But why not,
more simply‘ a year Ῥ Cicero (Epzls-t. ad Attzcum vi. 5)has exactly
the usage, “Etsi annuum tempus prope iam emeritum habebamus”
the year being regarded from the point of view of its duration. Here
the young man started presumably in March, but sailed to return in
November. He has had to stay during the winter, and aster the
second March his mother looks for him.

d· 11. cunctantem goes with trans aequora, and longius qualifies
xstinet.

13. She makes vows for his safe return, consults omens about it,
and prays for it.

14. curvo, ‘ embayed’.

1 Ι,5. desideriis icta fidelibus, ‘beart-stricken with a loyal long-
1n .

· g17. perambulat, of the grazing, not the ploughing steer.

17, 18. rura perambulat, nutrit rura. Page points out the
“ chiasmus’', a common figure in rhetoric, by which two words were
emphasized, the first corresponding with the fourth, and the second
with the third. If one is written under the other we get

Subject Verb. ,
Verb Χ Subjeet.

presenting a resemblance to the Greek X (chi).
