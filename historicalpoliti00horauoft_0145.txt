OTHER REFERENCES TO POLITICAL EVENTS.

It will be convenient to bring together the references to contem-
porary events which are to be found in Odes not included in this
selection.

Orodes 1. (otherwise Arsaces XIV.) resigned his kingdom to his
son Phraates IV. (Arsaces XV.), after the defeat inflicted on Pacorus
(see Introduction). Phraates, who is said to have begun his reign
by murdering his father, his thirty brothers, and his own grown-up
son, was expelled by his subjects, who set Tiridates on the throne.
(Tiridates was one of the royal house, but his relationship to Phraates
is not known.) The banished king was, however, re'stored before
long by the Scythiam, and Tiridates put himself under the protection
of Rome, taking with him his rival’s infant son. Phraates demanded
of the Romans the surrender of the fugitives. Augustus refused to

these events, except the last, which is fixed at the year 20 13.c.‚ are
not certain.. Dion Cassius ascribes the flight of Tiridates to the

found the emperor in Spain. This brings the occurrence down to
the year 2 5. Both Dion (155—240? A. D.) and Justin (400 Ρ A. n.) draw
their insormation from contemporary sources; but Dion was the more
careful of the two, and his account is more intrinsically probable.
Syria was a more likely locality than Spain for an interview be-
tween a Parthian pretender and Augustus.

In 1. xxvi. 3—5 the poet tells us that the favourite of the Muses is

mreless—

“quis sub Arcto
rex gelidae metuatur orae,
quod Tiridaten terreat ''.

This must refer to the time when Tiridates was still on the throne,
and alarmed at the prospect of the intervention of the Scythian king.
Others take the rex to mean some formidable Dacian prince, referred
to in Verg. Georg. ii. 497, “ aut coniurato descendens Dacus ab Istro'’.
In Odes 11. ii. 17—
