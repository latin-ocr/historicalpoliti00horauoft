14 onns OF HORAcE.

settling public affairs, their office to last for five years'.¹
Leaving the younger Pompeius undisturbed in Sicily, Octavius
and Antony sailed eastward to meet Brutus and his col-
leagues. An indecisive battle was fought at Philippi in
Macedonia, followed, after an interval of twenty days, by
another, which resulted in the entire rout of the republican
forces. Horace was serving in the defeated army, and was
fortunate enough to escape from the field. In the ode
from which I have already quoted (p. 13), he describes his ’

experiences—
‘⁶ Philippi's field

Witnessed our sall, when heroes fought in vain
And soiled with bloody lips Emathia's plain.
All lost, or fled. I fied without my shield!

Swift-sooted Hermes from on high

Wrapt in a cloud his trembling votary,

Thee refluent eddies whirled

Back to the struggles of a stormy world.·’ ²

The young man made his way, aster what interval of time
we do not know, to Rome. The Life attributed to Suetonius
tells us that he obtained his pardon. The small estate left
him by his father was probably lost, sor Venusia, his birth-
place, was in the territory confiscated to surnish allotments of
land for the victorious soldiers. He seems, however, to have
had some means left. Probably some faithful friend had
taken charge of some ready money which he now took the
opportunity to restore. Anyhow, Horace was able to buy a
clerkship in the treasury.³ And now his career as a poet
began. His own description of the causes that drove him
into literary activity must be given:

¹ ‘¹ ut tresviri respublicae constituendae per quinquennium essmt.” They were
therefore actually and legally, so sar as an appointment obviously extorted by
force was legal, triumvirs.

⁸ He was a scriba quaestorii. Long afterwards he had some connection with
the scribae, sor he mentions (Sat. 11. vi. 36) among the many distr-actions of a
day in Rome, a request from the corporation sor his advice on some matter that
touched their common interest-⁰1—
