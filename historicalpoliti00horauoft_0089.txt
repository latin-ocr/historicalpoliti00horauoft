NOTES. 8 5

41. iuvenem. The term included any one within the military
age (Le. under 45). Taking the date which Ι have suggested sor
this ode (Introduction, pp. 20—23)‚ Augustus would not be more than

35 years of age.

41—43. mutata...Maiae. filius is apparently a nominative sor a

vooetive, or it may be a nominative explanatory of a suppressed tu,

Ι ἷζηαέειὲἒ in line 36: ‘ if thou, verily the son, &c.‚ dost with changed
, . .

44. Caesaris ultor. So Suetonius, “Nihil convenientius duxit
quam necem avunculi vindicare '’. (Oct. 10.)

45. redeas, as if to a natural horne. Cf. Verg. Georg. i. 24, “Tuque
adeo, quem mox quae sint habitura deorum Ι concilia incertum est ”.

47. iniquum. As aequus means ‘kindly', so inzqnus gives the
idea of hostility.

48. ocior, ‘too speedy’.

49. triumphos is object of ames, as is dici. The triumphs of
August 6, 7, 8, 29 B.c., sor Pannonia, Dalmatia, Egypt.

50. See Introduction, p. 23.

51. Medos, equivalent to Persae in line 22.

51. equitare. So in Odes 1. xix. 11, “Versum animosum equis

1, 2. See Introduction, p. 23.

1. tempus in ultimum, ‘the last extremity’, ‘the extremity of
peril ’. So Catullus, xiv. 151, “ supremo in tempore ’'.

2. There is possibly a play on the words deducte—duee.

3. quis. The question is rhetorical, and does not require an
answer. It simply expresses a pleased surprise. Os course the only
person or power that could have restored the exile to his country
was Augustus.

3. Quiritem, ‘a citizen once ’ωσι-ε’, no longer capitis minor, as
arpagxglfepigggd be. This is better than to contrast it with miles, ‘ a

5. prime, ‘first', ‘dearoest
5. sodalium, ‘ comradae '. The word expresses the easy intimacy

os equals, and no question of compar-ison between Pompeius and the
friends of after years—virgil, Varius, Maecenas.
