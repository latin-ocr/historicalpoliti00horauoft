110 ODES OF HORACE.

1. tonantem is emphatic. The thunder is the sign of the power.

2. praesens, ‘ here on earth ³, probably with the additional sense
of ‘favour'. Cf. “ Adsis, O Tegeaee, favens '' (Verg. Georg. i. 18).

3. Britannis. Augustus appears to have had at one time an in-
tention to conquer Britain; but it was never carried out. Cf. XIX.
29. Certain British princes, probably expelled from their country,
came to Rome to seek help from Augustus, made some presents
(which were deposited in the Capitol) and surrendered the island to
him.

3. adiectis Britannis, ‘ when the Britons shall have been added’.

5. coniuge barbara. This ablative might be taken with maritus,
or with turpis, but it is better to describe it as one of the ‘ circum-
stances' of vixit; to call it absolute seems to stretch that term some-
what. ‘ Lived a degraded husband with a barbarian wife.'

6-8. hostium socerorum in armis. Page quotes Conington’s
excellent rendering, “ earning his foemen kinsmen’s pay ''. Bentley ⁸
suggested arvis for armis, an attractive conjecture, which has some
support in the MSS.

7. inversi, ‘corrupted’. This sense seems not to be found else·
where. It affects curia (‘senate-house' sor ‘senate’) as well as
mores,

8. consenuit. The disaster of Carrhae happened in 55 B.c.

9. sub rege. Observe how every word heightens the effect. “
They are content to live under the odious rule of a king, a Parthian
king, and they of the best blood in Italy. The Marsi fought an equal
fight with Rome in the Social War3 the poet compliments his coun-
trymen the Apulians, by coupling them with the famous Marsi.

10. anciliorum, for the legend see Ovid, Fasti iii. 345—384 The
common form is ancile.

10. togae, the toga was the ceremonial dress. ‘⁴ Romanos rerum
dominos, gentemque togatam’' (Verg. Aen. i. 282). Augustus was
inclined to be strict in requiring its use. Suetonius relates that he
gave injunctions to the aediles to make the wearing of it obligatory
in the forum (Aug. xl. 3).

11. aeternae, ‘undying’, the fire kept alight in the temple of
Vesta, the ‘hearth of Rome ’.

12. ‘ While Jupiter's shrine (in the Capitol) and the City of Rome
still stand unhurt.’ If these had perished, the prisoners could not
have behaved more basely.

14. condicionibus, a dative.

15. trahentis, ‘deducing from the precedent’, exemplo. This
sense of traho is not found elsewhere, but there is possibly a parallel
in the use of duco, ‘to consider'. Another reading is trahenti (agree-
