boards, 1⁸. ed.

“A very young child may be made to understand what a sentence is, aud to
break lt up into subject and prodiente. When once the foundation is laid, the
meaning ot noun and verb will naturally follow, and a knowledge ot adjective,
adverb, and the other parts ot speech may be surely superimposed. This is the
method which has been consistently followed in The Pupam English Grammar.
