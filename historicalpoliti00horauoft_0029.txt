boast that he had found a Rome of brick and lest a Rome os
marble was amply justified by the facts. The list¹ of great
buildings, sacred and secular, erected or restored by him is
a sufficiently significant comment on Horace's words in XI.

The six odes which follow are, more or less, on the same
theme. As Mr. Wickham puts it in his introduction to the
Third Book of the Odes—“ The unity of purpose is obvious.
The ends social‚ moral, religious, political‚ which a good
government should set before itself in Rome are reviewed‚
and it is more than once promised that Caesar’s reggime is
to compass thern.'' XVIII. is conceived in the same spirit,

The Temple os Apollo Palatinus, of Divus Julius, Jupiter Feretrius, Jupiter
Tonans, Quirinus, Minerva, Juno Regina, Jupiter Libertatis, Lares, Penates,
Juventas, Mater Magna. Eighty-two temples restored in the year 28. The
Senate-house and lobby, the Porticus Octavia, Aqueducts, the Forum Jufium, the
Basilica Julia.
