mmonucnou. 23

ode probably belongs to the year 28. This is indicated by
the expression, “hic ames dici Pater atque Princeps⁷’. It is
true that the title Pater Patriae was not formally bestowed
on Augustus till many years aster any date which can
possibly be assigned to this poem. It was decreed by the
Senate in B.C. 2, when Horace had been dead six years.
But the title is a general one. Ovid (quoted by Mr. wick-
ham) says (Fasti ii. 127)—

‘¹Sancte Pater patriae, tibi Plebs, tibiCuria nomen
hoc dedit; hoc dedimus nos tibi nomen, Eques;
res tamen ante dedit''.

It had been given to Camillus, to Cicero, to Julius Caesar
(after his death). It is useless as an indication of time.
Princeps, on the other hand, is a word os a more technical
kind. As this was given to Augustus in 28, it will be better
to attribute the ode to that year.

To about the same time we may attribute IX. We know
nothing of the Pompeius Varus to whom it is addressed,
except that he had fought on the losing side at Philippi, and
that he had been an intimate friend of the poet. Some have
thought that it belongs to the year 39, when one of the
provisions of the peace with S. Pompeius was that all the
banished should be permitted to return. This peace, how-
ever, was very short-lived, and it is sase to conclude that the
poem refers to the general amnesty which followed Augustus’
unquestioned supremacy.

Possibly X. is of about the same date. C. Asinius Pollio
was a man of the highest principles and of commanding

Where'er thy reign (sor not if heu invite

To wield the sceptre os eternal night,

Ne'er would such lust of dire dominion move

Thee, Caesar, to resign the realm os Jove,

Though vaunting Greece extol th’ Elysian plain,

whence weeping Ceres νοσῶ her child in vain),

Bmthe favour-ing gales, my course propitians guide,

O'er the rude swain’s uncertain path preside.

Now, now invoked, assert thy heavenly birth,

And Iam to hear our prayer, a god on earth.”
