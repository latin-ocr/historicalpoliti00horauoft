1 36 onEs or HORACE.

XX IV.

Horace, aster his manner, depreciates his own genius. A Pindar
may sing of gods and heroes ; but to attempt his themes means
disaster sor men of humbler gifts. l, says the poet, am no ..swan
soaring into tlze sky, but a bee busy in tlte lmmble lask of guthering
from tlzeflowers tlzeir sweets. You, my friend Antonius, may attempt
ltfftier tlzemes, suclz as is llze praise of Caesar, cln‘esgift eff heaven to
eartlz. And even l, when he comes back victorious, may help lo swell
llce strain of triumph.

1. aemulari: “aemulari with the accusative is used of an honest
and noble rivalry, with the dative of mean and ignoble envy''. (Page.)

2. Iule. Iulus Antonius was born in 42 B.C., and was the younger
son of the triumvir M. Antonius by Fulvia, Antony’s second wife.
Octavia, sister of Augustus, married to Antony in B.C. 40, brought
him up. He was married to Octavia's daughter Marcella. Augustus
took him into favour, and he became praetor in B.C. 13, and consul
in Rc. 10. He was involved in the guilt of Julia, and compelled
to commit suicide (B.C. 2). Iulus is not known as a' praenomen,
and it can hardly stand sor Iiilus or for Iuli, the vocative os Iulius.
Antonius was connected with the Julian family through his sather’s
mother Julia, sister of Julius Caesar, consul 64 B.C.—llle has been
conjectured, and is approved, though not adopted, by Page.

2- Ope depends upon ceratis.
3, 4. Cf. Odes 1. iii. 32-3-

“expertus vacuum Daedalus aeta
pennis non homini datis ''.

‘⁶ Horace has no sympathy with human enterprise, and Daedalus in
his favourite type of the vanity of scientific ambition'' (Page).

4. nomina. So Ovid (Trist. i. 90), “ Icarus Icariis nomina fecit
aquis’': the plural is a lieense taken for metrical reasons.

6. aluere, ‘have swollen’, lit. ‘fattened’. There is a various
{legii-Eg cum (imbres)...saliere. “ Absurda lectio’', says Orelli; Page

7, 8. The metaphor is kept up in fervet, ‘boils‘; immensus
‘ kept within no boundaries'; ruit, ‘ rushes'; and profundo, ‘ deep’.
It is dropped in ore, ‘ utterance'.

7. immensusque. For this peculiarity os metre see Appendix D.

9—14. Horace briefly describes four kinds of poetry in which
Pindar excelled, in all os which he is ‘worthy to be gifted with
Apollo's bay’: (1) in 10-12‚ Ditlzyrambi (properly 'songs in honour
of the nativity of Bacchus, but extended to others themes); (2) in
13—16, Paeans, hymns in honour of gods and heroes; (3) in 17-20‚
Triumphal Odes (Epinieia), written to celebrate victories at the great
