seems toffie this. It would be natural to speak of excipere solem
when a room is built, as a winter sitting-room sometimes was, to
catch the sunshine from rise to set (so Juv. vii. 18, “algentem
rapiat caenatio solem”). Horace transfers the expression to the
opposite aspect. The colonnade is said to catch the north, i.e. had
a northern aspect only, opacus meaning shady as opposed to lucidus.

17, 18. We must not insist on the literal meaning of this passage,
which would be that there were in the early days of Rome laws sor-

pitrifding the use of any more costly material sor roofing houses than

17. fortuitum, ‘easua1‘, i.e. what might be found anywheoe, and
therefore chaep.

19, 20. The two ablatives sumptu (abl. of ‘ condition’) and saxo
(‘ instrument’) depend on decorare.

f 2to3tnovo‚ ‘newly eut’, i.e. sor the purpose, and so opposed to
or ut um.

There are bounds to all human greatness, the superior power os
Jupiter, and the all-embracing doom of death. Contentmcnt is the only
true wealtlt. T he man who moderates his des-ires no fluctuations ql
fhrtune trouble, while no wealtlt or luxury banish care from tlte soul.
For me my humble Sabine home is enough.

1. profanum vulgus, the ‘unhallowed' or ‘uninitiated throng'=
βέβηλος. The prosimus was the person not allowed to enter the
shrine (sanum), or, in the Temple at Jerusalem, not to go beyond
the court of the Gentiles. So Virgil (Aen. vi. 258, where Aeneas
and the Sibyl are about to enter the sacred grove of Avernus),
“ procul, procul este profani’'.

1. arceo, ‘keep off ’, i.e. ‘forbid to approach'. This line ex-
presses the first injunction of the officiating priest, that all the un-
initiated were to depart. So Callimachus (lemn. in Apoll. ii. 2),
ἑκάς, ἑκάς, ὅστις ἀλιτρός.

2. favete linguis. Here we have the second injunction—silence.
linguis is ablative; ‘favour’‚ ‘assist’ the rite as far as speech is con·
eemed. Utter none but propitious words (εὐφημεῖτε). This was
really equivalent to silence. In order to be sure that no word of
e'vil omen was uttered nothing was said at all. So Virgil (Am.
v. 71), “ore favete omnes''.

2. carmina, ‘hymns', i.e. a new revelation or message from
heaven (non prius audita).

3. Musarum saeerdos=sacer vates.

4. virginibus puerisque, i.e. to the young as the hope os the
nation. The volgus of his own contemporaries the poet despairs os;
