ing picture or representation, and indeed an ancient Etruscan mirror
from Perugia exists representing Athopa (Atropos or Destiny) in
the act of tixing a nail with a hammer, symbolizing an immutably

fixed decision'’ (Page).
18. clavos trabales, a ‘ spike', a nail of the largest size, such
as might be used for fixing a beam.

18. cuneos, another form of fastening. It may be, however,
that as the clavus was used to fasten firmly, so the cuneus was used

to s lit.
15. severus, cf. the epithet αὐθαδής, which is applied by Aeschylus
to the wedge used in the imprisonment of Prometheus, ‘unyielding’.

20. uncus, ‘cramp’. The molten lead was used to attach this
firmly to the stone which it was intended to keep in its place.

21, 22. albo panno. Servius tells us that those who made offer-
ings to Fides wrapped the hand in a white eloth.

21. rara, ‘ seldom found ’.
22. comitem abnegat, ‘refuses her companionship' (Page).

23, 24. Wickham points out the confusion in the allegory. “ Hope
and loyal friends are consolations of adversity, so that Horace must
mean, not that they go with F ortune when she deserts a man, but
that they cling to him, to his changed estate as to his unchanged.
Yet is this is the case, in what sense is she said to be inimica?''

23, 24. mutata veste, a common phrase for ‘to put on monming’.
so Cicero (Post Red. iii. 8), “ pro me praesente senatores et viginti
milia hominurn vestem mutaverunt '’.

26, 27. The Greek proverb, ζεῖ χύτρα, ζῆ φιλία, has been well
compared by Wickham. Cf. Shakespeare’s Timon.

28. ferre, by a stretch of the infinitive construction, is made to
follow dolosi, ‘too treacherous to bear'. It might follow the
simple fugiunt (as Odes 1. iii. 19, “quid sit futurum cras fuge quae-
rere ''); ficgiuntferre might be said, bnt hardly diff‘ugy'untferre.

28. ferre iugum pariter:lo·‹p ζινγῷ.

29. ultimos. So Verg. (Eclog. i. 67), “et penitus toto divisos
orbe Britannos ''. Cf. XV. 33.

30, 31. recens examen, ‘new levy'. Examen commonly means
‘a swarm ’‚ as from ex-ago, what is led or driven out3 also an exarn-
ination‚ when a thing ex-agitur‚ is thoroughly discussed.

32. Oceano rubro, the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.

34. fratrum. The very thought of brothers reminds us of civil
strise. There is no need to add any explanatory phrase.

34, 35. dura aetas, a hard-hearted generation.
