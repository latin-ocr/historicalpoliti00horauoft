74 ODES OF HORACE.

Taking the reading of the text, which is at least as old as Porphyrion
(probably 5th or 6111 century), we must explain it either as equal to
“ quibus vita iucunda est, si te superstite vivatur, si contra, gravis'’,

or as resulting from a confusion of the two ways of expressing the ,

idea, “quibus vita iucunda [est] si tu superstes sis''‚ and “quibus vita
iucunda [est] te superstite”. The actual end os the poet’s life, a few
months after his patron⁷s death, in the year 8, is a pathetic comment
on these words.

7. iussi, ‘at your bidding’.

8. ni tecum simul, understand persequamur, ‘unless we pursue
it in your company'.

9. Perhaps it is better to understand persequemur from line 7 and
make laborem the object both of it and of laturi, ‘or are we to
pursue this task, bound on enduring it in the spirit (mente equiva-
lent to animo) with which a man not a coward should endure it’.

Possihly, we may supply sumus after laturi, though such an ellipsis
of the auxiliary verb is most unusual.

11. feremus answers the question put in lines 7—10 by accepting
the second alternative.

11-14. He is willing to traverse mountains (the Alps in the west,
the Caucasus in the east) or sea (the unknown ocean). Ι

12. inhospitalem. So Aeschylus speaks of the Caucasus as
ἀπάνθρωπος.

15. roges, potential ‘you may ask ’.

16. imbellis, ‘unused to war ’, cf. IX. 10.

16. firmus parum, ‘ feeble of srame ’. 1t refers to his health.

17. sum futurus. The indicative is used as expressing his con-
viction of the fact.

18. maior habet, ‘possesses with greater force '.

19. assidens. The participle is not used in its strict time sense,

ἰξυῖ ads'equivalent to quae assidet, ‘ a bird that has in charge a cauow
roo .

21. relictis, probably dative.

21. ut adsit, ‘though she be there’.

22. praesentibus This is almost superfluous, but yet increases
the force of the picture.

23. militabitur. The passive is unusual, but there is another
instance in Plautus, Pers. ii. 2. 5ο, “illa militia militatur'’.

24. in spem, ‘to further the hope ’.

25. pluribus. The larger the estate the more oxen would be
wanted sor the plough. According to one Roman writer on agri-
culture, a pair was wanted for every 60 acres, according to another,

for every 48.
