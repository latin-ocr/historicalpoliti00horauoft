12. immetata iugera, an emphatic contrast. We Romans
'kgobvguzit'i ὃ11ῗῖιὲ only in measured plots—-so many iugera3 they have

fruges and Cererem.

fighting men from each of their hundred cantons; the others culti-
vate the ground. In the following year the cultivators fight and
the warriors cultivate. No land is private property or marked off ;

24. aut, (si peccant or peccantibus) the wage or penalty is to die.

25. impias, used, as frequently, of civil strife, because it breaks
up family ties.

27, 28. To have the titulus of ‘ Pater' inscribed upon his statues.
The actual titulus would not be these words, but some adaptation

Quintus, bids him deserve the title of “parens Asiae ''. In one
extant inscription Augustus is called parens coloniae.

29. Cs. XX. 9, 10.
