“Quotiens Cyclopum effervere‘ m agros
vidimus undantem ruptis fornacibus Aetnam,
flammarumque globos liquefactaque volvere saxa”

ἔστι πῦρ ὑπὸ τῇ σποδιῃ is quoted from Callimachus, and‘ ‘ignotos
vestigia ferre per ignes’ ’from Propertius (Ι. v. 5).

9. paullum, more commonly paullisper, ‘for a while' .
9. severae, ‘stately'. So in Sat. 1. x. 42—

“ Pollio regum
facta canit pede ter percusso '’.

11. res publicas, ‘ the history of the state ’.

11. ordinaris, ‘shall have set forth in order', as in St. Luke,
i. 1., where the Vulgate has “ multi conati sunt ordinare''.

11. grande munus, ‘your lofty task’.

κά. cothurno, ‘buskin’‚ zie. tragic drama, as opposed to the
soccus: comedy. The ablative follows repeteS. ‘ You will return
with or on the Attic buskin.'

publicis ita sim versatus ut defenderim multos laeserim neminem’

(Div. in Q. Caecilium, i.)
14. consulenti, ‘ deliberating’ .

15. laurus. The victorious general carried a laurel bough in his
hand and wore a wreath of laurel. This laurel wreath he was per-
mitted to wear for the remainder of his life at public spectacles.

17. cornu. This was shaped like a ῦς the lituus was straight,
with a curved end.

18. perstringis. Perhaps it is safer to take this difficult word as

eyes by being blinded (perstringere is used of this effect also). The
sense of ‘ hurting’ generally we have in such an expression as

19. fugaces is proleptic: ‘ terrifies the horses into flight'.

20. voltus, used especially of the expression of the face. The
sudden flash of arms turns the horses to ssight and puts the expression
of sear into the eyes of the riders.

21. audire, ‘to hear of ⁹, i.e. to read os. This is certainly to
