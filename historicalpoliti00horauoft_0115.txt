ing with exemplo, which would then be governed by dissentientis).
The precedent would draw or bring ruin.

17, 18. si non...pubes. This would be the exemplum, the
Senate intervening to save the prisoners from the consequences of
their own cowardice—the precedent would be established, ‘if the
mptive youth were not suffered to die unpitied ’.

17. periret. The lengthening of the ·et is to be observed3 it is
without parallel in Horace’s use of the Alcaie metre. Still it is pre-
ferable to the conjecture perirent.

Page bestows more commendation than it seems to me to deserve
on Pliiss's arrangement of this passage. Pliiss puts a full stop after
periret, and makes captiva pubes immiserabiltk an exclamation. Re-
gulus is in this ease the subject of periret, while sit must be understood
after pubes. Both seem not a little harsh.

18. signa “has soree as the first word in Regulus’ speech, striking
again the keynote of the ode, recalling the bitterest memory of Car-
rhae, the loss of the standards '³ (Wickham).

20-22. Page mlls attention to the brilliant antitheses militibus
sine caede, civium retorta...1ibero‚ warriors who surrendered

without fighting, free Romans who had become Carthaginian slaves.

Laiiriislgffltibus' Δ Cf. Verg. Aen. xi. 193, “spolia occisis derepta

22. tergo, an ablative of place.

23. portas. In the earlier part of his campaign Regulus had shut
up the Carthaginians within their walls. Now the gates were open ς
they were secure, enjoying “ apertis otia portis ’‘ (Ars Poet. 191).

23, 24. ‘ Fields once ravaged by our arms cultivated again.’
25. seilicet, as frequently is the case, ironical.

26—30. It is a stroke of art in the poet that the ironioel mood
lasts for so short a time. Indignation carries the speaker away.
damnum is scarcely ironical, as Page thinks. To speak os ransom-
ing useless soldiers as a lucrum would have been irony. But the
position os the word emphasizes it; it is an atrocious crime; but it is
also what will trouble you more, a heavy loss. You will be spending
your money in vain. This is satire rather than irony.

28. refert, ‘bears again, i.e. ‘ recovers'.

28. medicata, ‘doctored ¹. So the Greek φαρμάσσειν.
28. fucus, a lichen used as a red dye.

30. curat, ‘cares ’, ‘is willing'=‘can'.

30. deterioribus, probably the dative following reponi, ⁸ be given
back ’. “ Detm'ores fiunt ex bonis, peiores ex malis ’' (Scholiast).

31. extricata must be middle. ‘ If (and only if, i.e. in no other
mse) the hind can extricate herself from the close net and fight’.
