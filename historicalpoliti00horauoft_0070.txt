Wy this renewal of civil strise? Has not enough of Roman blood
been shed, not to conquer a fhrezgrn fhe, but to bring about our own
ruin? T lte very beasts never rage against their own kind. What is
the cause? The hereditary curse of tlte blood of Remus.

1. scelesti. Scelus is the strongest expression for crime possible.
Cf. VIII. 29, “cui dabit partes scelus expiandi Iuppiter ''.

2. conditi, ‘sheathed’, i.e. after the battle of Philippi.

3. Cf. X. 34—6, where ora answers to the campis and mare to
the Neptuno of this passage.

5. invidae, ‘rival’. Cf. ΙΙ. 5.

7. intactus, ‘unconquered’. The two expeditioris of Julius
Caesar are, so to speak, ignored. So Tacitus, Agric. xiii. “ Divus
Iulius cum exercitu Britanniam ingressus, quanquam prospera
pugna terruerit incolas ac litore potitus sit, potest videri ostendisse
posteris, non tradidisse.’' A less likely interpretation would supply
prius. Roman blood is shed, not as by Scipio to destroy Rome’s
great rival, or by Caesar to subdue the yet unconquered Britain.

7. descenderet. The triumphal procession was marshalled out-
side the city in the Campus Martius. (The general had been waiting
outside till the senate authorized the triumph.) It entered by the
Porta Triumphalis, opened on such occasions only, and having tra-
versed a considerable part of the city, as the Velabrum, the Forum
Boanum, made the circuit of the Palatine, &c.‚ entered the Via Sacra.
This road led down by a slope of between fifty and usixty feet to the

Forum (the word descendo is frequently used of approaching the ¹

Forum). The ascent to the Capitol (clivus Capitolinus), (which was
winding, in order to make the rise easy) began at the end os the Via
Sacra. At this point the captives were led off to the carcer Tullia-
nus, but the descenderet does not refer to thiS, but to the downward
slope traversed before the Forum was reached.

9. sua. Cf. ΙΙ. 2.

11-12. hic is explained by what follows in line 12. Supplygenus
after dispar. 1t is best to take the adjective feris in close connec-
tion with nisi in dispar. ‘Neither with the wolf nor> the bear
