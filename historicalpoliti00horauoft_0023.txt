Italy in charge οι the domestic administration of affairs.
On the other hand, he did accompany Augustus in the
expedition against Sex. Pompeius. My own opinion, which,
1 must, however, confess, has changed during the preparation
of this text-book, inclin'es to the Actium theory. If so, IV.
and V. belong to much the same time.

The five years between 36 and 31 were employed by
Augustus in consolidating his power in the West. Spain,
Africa, and Gaul were reduced to order by his able lieu-
tenants, Statilius Taurus, Domitius Calvinus, and M.
Agrippa. The one foreign war of importance that occurred

Still, the situation may well have seemed threatening.
During the winter of 32—31 a huge fleet and army lay at
Actium, ready, as soon as the spring began, to descend upon
Italy. It was only too possible that the orderly government‚
which had given to the West a sense of secur'ity that had
long been absent, might be overthrown, that the Ship of State
might be at sea again, to use a common metaphor, in the
