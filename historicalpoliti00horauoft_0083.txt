28. mutavit, see note on IV. 28.

28. sagum, ‘the military cloak'‚ properly of the common soldier,
but used here generally as opposed to the civilian dress, the tog a,
and further qualified by the adjective punice, which identifies it witli
the garment of the general in command.

29-31. Cretam and Syrtes are the objects of petit. ‘He is
making either for Crete’, &e.

29. centurn nobilem urbibus, the epithet is borrowed from
Homer (ἑκατόμπολις, Iliad 1i. 649).

30. non suis, ‘not favourable’. So Senem, Epp. 71. 3, ‘Igno-
ranti quem portiim petat nullus suus est ventus”.

31.hex,ercitatas, ‘vexed’, ‘lashed’; so the “still vexed' Ber-
moot oe '. -

32. incerto. The adjective is transferred from the traveller to
the clement on which he travels. The fugitive is making his way
either to Crete or to the African coast—in either mse without any
choice of his own, but availing himself of the winds that happen to
blow3 or he is careless whither the sea is taking him.

34. Chian and Lesbian wines were sweet, Caecuban dry.

36. metire, ‘measure out’. The wine and water were mixed
with so many cyathi or ladles of each.

37. rerum is the objective genitive aster curam metumque, ‘our
anxiety and sear about the fortunes of Caesar’.

VII.

772 time sor rq'oicing has come. AEtherto our anxieties· have been
too gram,- but Caesar has broken the strengt h qfthe enemy. T he great

queen, who meditated Rome’s ruin, is dead, dead by lter own leand
rather than grace a Roman triumph.

This· is the first Alcaic ode that we have from the pen of Horace.
Two harsh sounding lines (5 and 14) are to be found in it. Τὴε
whole bears traces of haste and want of finish. The first clause· is a
’ translation from Alcaeus, νῦν χρὴ μεθύσθην.

1, 2. This would be a very unusual expression of joy. A Roman
gentleman would hardly dance under any circumstances. “Nemo
sere saltat sobrius''‚ says Cicero. pulsanda and pede libero both
strengthen the phrase. So of the rejoicing of the Faunalia <Odes 111.
xviii. 15, 16), “Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor Ι ter pede terram ”.

2. Saliaribus, adjective from Salii, priests of Mars. For the
splendour of priestly banquets generally, cf. Odes 11. xiv. 28, “mero
Pontificum potiore coenis’' ,for the Salii in particular, Ci'cero Ad
Atticum v. 9. (of an entertainment prepared for him by order os At-
ticus),‘ ‘cum epulati essemus Saliarem in modum'’.
