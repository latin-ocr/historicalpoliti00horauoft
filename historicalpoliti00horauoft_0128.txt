124 ODES OF HORACE.

35, 36. The suicide os Cato after the battle of Thapsus (B.c. 46).
Such a reference proves both the strength of the imperial rdgime and
the independence of the poet's spirit. A weak government could not
have permitted it, and a mere flatterer never thought os making it.

37. Scauros. M. Aemilius Scaurus, Consul 115 and 107 B.C.,
Censor 109 (when he constructed the Via Aemilia). His name seems
to have stood conventionally for a great Roman, cs. Juven. xi. 90—

“ Cum tremerent autem Fabios durumque Catonem
et Scauros et Fabricios ''‚

thngh he was of indifferent character. No other Scaurus attained
ce e rlty.

38. Aemilius Paullus refused to escape after the defeat of Cannae
(B.C. 216). ‘⁴ Memet in hac strage militum meorum patere exspirare”
were his last words to Cn. Lentulus, who would have given him his
horse. (Liv. xxii. 49.)

39. insigni, perhaps opposed to humilis, i.e. the trivial verse
which Horace affects to consider his peculiar r6le3 perhaps, as Page
has it, ‘giving renown'. gratus might then mean ‘grateful'; as a
Roman, the poet pays these heroes’ services with the meed of fame
that verse bestows.

40. Fabricium, Consul 282 and 278 B.c.‚ distinguished sor his
conduct in the war with Pyrrhus. His honourable scorn os the

traitor and his contentment in poverty were stock stories in the
Roman annals.

41. Curius Dentatus, Consul 275 B.c.‚ when the battle of Bene-
ventum was won. He was one os the bearded heroes of Roman
antiquity. Shaving became fashionable with the younger Scipio.
Cato (the Elder), as a representative of the conservative party, was
inlonsus.

43, 44. apto cum lare, ‘with an appropriate homestead’.

45. occulto. The idea of occulto properly belongs to crescit,
though belonging also to aevo. So Lucr. (ii. 315), “occulto de-
crescit vomer in arvis ''.

46. Marcelli, ’see Introduction, p. 26. The first Marcellus cap-
tured Syracuse B.C. 212, cf. Verg. Aen. vi. 860-886.

47. Iulium sidus. This and Caesaris astrum were terms applied
to the great comet which appeared about the time os Caesar’s death,
{icc} sit}t waa75 —supposed to signisy his reception into heaven. So Verg.

“ Ecce Dionaei processit Caesaris astrum ''.
Here there is a reference to this, as well as to the more general ideo.

of the star that rules the fortunes of a house. Marcellus derives
splendour from the Julian star.
