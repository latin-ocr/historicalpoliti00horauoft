37. iocis, ‘joyous themes’. q
38. retractes, ‘ handle again’, ‘take up anew'.

38. neniae, ‘dirge'. Simonides was famous for his θρήνυι

born in Ceos. Hence the epithet Ceae.

39. Dionaeo. Dione was the mother of Venus (ll. v. 405). So

2, 3. latius extenta, &c.‚ enlarged to wider bounds than the Lucrine
Lake. This lake was a salt-water lagoon, separated from the Gulf
of Baiae by a bank of sand, on which a road was constructed. As
