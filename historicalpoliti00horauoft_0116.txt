112 ODES OF HORACE.

33. perfidis, opposed to credidit; so in Odes 111. vii. 13, we have
the two words in juxtaposition‚ “ut Proetum mulier perfida credu-
lum ³³. The epithet is often applied to the Carthaginians without any
particular justification. The reproach applies at least equally to the
dealings of Rome.

34. proteret, ‘trample down '‚ ‘crush’.
34. altero, ‘second ’‚ ‘renewed’.

36. iners: as ars is frequently used sor ‘ character ’, iners (in-ars)
often means ‘idle ’, ‘spiritless'.

ἐξ. hic. The speaker points, as it were, to one of the offending
SO lers-

37. unde inscius, ‘not knowing whence he could win life’,
zze, escape from death. So Conington: ‘⁶ He knows not, he, how
ξξενέειὲῖιῖη ”. He ought to have known that it was only to be won

38. pacem duello miscuit, ‘has confounded peace and war ³,
zze. indulged thoughts of peace when nothing but war should have
been in his mind. Orelli suggests that the soldier who bargains. for
peace usurps the functions of the state and becomes a public enemy.

38. duellum, the archaic word for bellum, probably connected
with duo. Cf. duo and bis; so there is dnonas, an archaic form of
bonus. So in one of the fragments os Livius Andronicus’ translation
of the Othtssqy we have “ duona eorum portant ad naves ”.

40. ruinis, a causal ablative, ‘exalted by the downsall’, better
{RES itthe ablative of comparison, as Marshall, following Orelli,

41. fertur, ‘ he is said ’. The narrative is resumed from line 18,
the speech of Regulus being ended.

42. capitis minor; the legal phrase is capite deminutus. “ Ca-
pite deminutus est qui in hostium potestatem venit” is the definition
of the lexicographer Festus. Caput expresses the capacity of legal
rights enjoyed by a Roman, these being classed under three heads—
the freedom which he enjoyed as born in a free condition, his rights
as a citizen, his rights as the member of a familia. Capital punish-
ment in English always means death; but poena capitalis· in Roman
law was applied to punishment that affected the caput or legal status
of the condemned, as exile.

42. capitis, a genitive of respect ; cf. captus animi, integer vitae.
44. torvus, ‘frowning'.
44. voltum, ‘his regard'‚ the expression of his face.

45, 46. donec, until he confirmed3 firmaret is really equivalent,
as often in the diction of poetry, to firmasset.

45. consilio is opposed by Orelli to sententia. This latter,
