APPENDLX D.

 

HORACE’S METRES.

The odes and Epodes of Horace exhibit as many as nineteen
varieties of metre. In this selection we are not coneerned with
more than seven of these. These seven may be briefly described.

Extracts L, 111., 1V.‚ and VI. are written in iambic couplets, the
first line consisting os six feet (trimeter) and the second of four
(dimeter). The second, fourth, and sixth are iambs (ν -); the
first, third, and fifth may be spondees (——-). Other feet are
ocoesionally admitted. In IV. 27 the second soot is a tribrach
(ν ν ν), which is equivalent to an iamb, as two short syllables are
regarded as equal to one long. In I. 3 the third foot is a dactyl
(- ν ν), equivalent, on the same principle, to a spondee.

Extract ΙΙ. is written in couplets of which the first is a dactylic
hexameter (similar to the verse in which the Aeneid of virgil, the
Metamorphoses of Ovid‚ etc„ are written), the second is a trimeter
iambic. It is to be noticed, however, that the iambic lines eonsist
of iambs only, no other foot being admitted. Lines so constructed
are called pure iambics.

Fourteen of the selected odes are written in the Alcaic metre.
These are VIL, IX.—XVII.‚ XIX., XXI., ΧΧΙῙ., XXV. This is
a mette which Horace adopted with some variations from the Greek
poet Alcaeus. It is a stanza of four lines, in which the first and
second are of this form—-

----- u-vv-vv>

Very rarely the first syllable os the line is short* There is almost
always a pause after the fifth syllable3 or, in other words, it very
seldom happens that a word is found belonging partly to the first

and partly to the second half of the line. One os these rare excep-
tions will be found in VII. 14—-

mentemque lymphatam Mareotico,

where the fifth and sixth syllables are found in the same word. The
third line of the stanza is of this form—

—————————

Here again the first syllable is very rarely found short. The fourth
line is as follows :—

Next to the Alcaic may be mentioned the Sapphic metre. This
was borrowed, again with variations‚ from Sappho, a poetess con-
temporagrovyith Alcaeus, and like him a native of the island ofK Lesbos.
