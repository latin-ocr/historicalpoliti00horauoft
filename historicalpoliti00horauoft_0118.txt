114 omas or HORACE.

2. templa, the templa were, strictly speaking, the sacred en-
closures (τέμενος), though the word is used here generally of the
buildings, which are more particularly described by aedes.

2. refeceris, so Verg. Aen. viii. 714—6—

“ Caesar.. .sacrabat
maxima ter centum totam delubra per urbem ''‚

and Ovid, Fasti, ii. 63—
“ Templorum positor, templorum sancte repostor''.

5. te geris, ‘ bear’ or ⁴ behave yourself'.

6. hine. Supply est. So Livy, xlv. 39, “maiores vestri omnia
magnarum rerum et principia exorsi ab Dis sunt, et finem statuerunt.

6. principium, scanned as consilium in XV. 41.
7. neglecti. Cf. XIII. 30.

9. Monaeses. It is not known who this was, the only person
of the name known to history being a Parthian noble who took
refuge with Antony from the tyranny of Phraates IV.‚ and had
something to do with the invasion of Parthia which took place in
B.C. 36. He cannot be meant3 the only alternative is to suppose
that the general of King Orodes 1. (Arsaces XIV.), who defeated
Crassus at Carrhae, bore this name, and that Surenas, the name by
which he is commonly known, was an official title, as it certainly
was in after time.

9. Pacori. Pacorus was the son of Orodes I. He was nomi-
nally in command at the battle of Antigoneia (B.C. 50), where the
Parthians were defeated, and commanded jointly with Labienus
(B.C. 40) when Antony’s lieutenant‚ Decidius Saxa, was defeated
and slain. He himself met the same fate in B.C. 38 (June 9th—the
fifteenth anniversary of Carrhae), in Cyrrhestice. 'l'he defeat ol
B.C. 40 is intended here.

10. non auspicatos. Velleius Paterculus (ii. 46) says of Crassus:
“ proficiscentem in Syriam diris cum ominibus tribuni plebis frustra
retinere conati sunt'’. Cicero refers to the story in De Diviu. i. 6,
and again in ii. 40. In the first, Q. Cicero is arguing for the truth
of omens; in the second, Cicero himself takes the other side, and
tells, evidently in ridicule, the story that the cry of a seller of figs
from Caunus (in Caria), “ Cauneas ''‚ heard while the army was em-
barking, was interpreted to mean—“cave ne eas ” (observe the iden-
tical pronunciation of the ‘ u' and ‘v'). The tribune was ‘noted’
by the Censor. Any undertaking of Antony would afterwards be
called non auspicatus.

12. renidet, ‘beams with joy’zgaudet, and so followed by an
infinitive. “It literally means ‘beams back· or ‘beams again',
and Horace almost seems to have selected a word which would
port1·ay the grin os satisfaction with which the face of a savage
