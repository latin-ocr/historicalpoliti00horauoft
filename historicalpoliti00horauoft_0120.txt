1 16 omas OF HORACE.

4 5. damnosa. Orelli quotes Ovid, Met. xv. 234—5—

“tempus edax rerum tuque invidiosa vetustas
quid non destruitis?”

XVIII.

Whatever your wealth and luxury, death awaits you, as it awaits
all. And even while you live, your existence is less lo be desind than
tlte simplicity and innocence qf the savage life. He who would be
called the fhtlzer of his country must restrain tlte license qf tlte time,
the ffminate training qf our youth, tlze greed ofgain that is never
satis ed.

Tjh‘iis is practically a repetition of the sentiments of the seven odes
marked XL—XVII.

1. intactis, ‘unrifled’. Cf. Odes 1. xxi. “Icci beatis nunc Ara-
bum invides Ι gazis?”

3, caementis, ef. XII. 33-38.

4. ΤῘιε two seas, Apulicum, upper (on the East Coast), and
Tyrrhenum, the lower (on the West). These names make excellent
sense, more than can be said of any other reading. Whatever diffi-
culty there may be in the scanning of Apulicum has been antici-
pated in XV. 10. Terrenum has been suggested for Tyrrhenum and
publicum for Apulicum. “ All the land and the sea, common heri-
tage.''

5. figit, the it is lengthened by the stress put upon it as the first
syllable of the foot.

6. summis verticibus, ‘the topmost roos ’ of the building, the·
foundations of which are the caementa, lowered by the rich man’s
contractors into the sea. When it is finished, Doom drives the
nails of adamant which are a part of her armoury (cf. odes 1. xxxv.
18, “saeva necessitas Ι clavos trabales...manu ί gestans aena ’') into
the roos, and so asserts, it may be said, her ownership. The
millionaire has built it all for her. The words have been made to
refer to the nails as driven in ‘ up to their heads '‚ and to the ⁴ head
of the man ἐ neither explanation seems at all satisfactory.

7, 8. With this impending you can never free your soul from sear,
nor your life from the snares of death.

9. campestres, ‘of the steppes'.
10. plaustra, so Aescb. P. V. 709—10—

Σκύθας δ’ ἀφίξει νομάδας οἳ πλεκτὰς στέγας
πεδάρσιοι ναίουσ’ ἐπ’ εὐκύκλοις ὄχοις.

10. rite, ‘aster their custom’.

11. rigidi gives a general idea of hardness; the old explanation
of ‘ srozen ' may be correct.
