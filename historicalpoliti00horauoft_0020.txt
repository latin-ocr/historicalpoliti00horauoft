16 omzs OF HORACE.

and moved to his brother's help, the consequences might
have been serious—nothing less, indeed, than another civil
war as formidable as that which had been settled by Philippi.
As it was, Antony, as it will be convenient to call him, was
too late, Perusia had fallen before he left Egypt. Even then
he sailed to Italy, and laid siege to Brundisium. Happily
for Rome a peace was patched up; a fresh division os the
provinces was made; and the new alliance was strengthened
by the marriage of Antony with the sister of Octavius. His
first wife, the cruel and unscrupulous Fulvia, had died in the
course of'the year.

The feud between Octavius and Antony was not the only
danger that threatened the peace of the Roman world. In
Sicily, Sextus Pompeius continued to hold his own in spite
of all the efforts that were made to subdue him. His fleet
commanded the Mediterranean, and the shores of Italy were
exposed to piratical attacks. In 39 an arrangement, known
as the Treaty of Misenum, was made with him, and for a
time there was peace.

The Eastern provinces of the Empire were in a deplorable
condition. Orodes, King of Parthia, who had sent a contin-
gent of cavalry to fight on the Republican side at Philippi,
crossed the Euphrates, and invaded the Roman dominions.
His army was led by T. Labienus, who had acted as envoy
of Brutus and Cassius to the Parthian court, and had
remained there after the defeat of his party. The Roman
troops in Syria, among whom the memory of Pompey was
still cherished‚ and who felt little love for the nephew and
heir of Caesar, joined him. The greater part of Asia Minor
was soon overrun. ’

The summer of 40<was then a period os almost unbroken
gloom. Antony and Octavius were almost at war; Sextus
Pompeius threatened Ita1y; the Parthians were victorious in
the East. Then things began to mend. The Triumvirs were
reconciled; Pompeius was bought off ; and Ventidius Bassus
drove back the Parthians into their own territory3 repeating
his victory over them with such effect in the following year
