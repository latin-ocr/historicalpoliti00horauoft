13. furor caecus, &e The altematives are ‘blind madnoes’,
‘overpowering force [of fater, ‘deliberate guilt’. He asks his
countrymen which‚they choose as accounting for their act. They
are silent; and he replioe. It is fate, the deadly inheritance of the
fratricide of Romulus. Or culpa may mean ‘the guilt of a bygone
time’.

19. ut, ‘from when ’‚ or ‘ever since ’. Cf. XXI. 42.

20. sacer, with an active sense, ‘ bringing a curse upon'.

ΙΙ.

Rome is bent on working her own ruin. Let us imitate the Phocaeam
os old, and leave our country, binding ourselves under a curse never to
return till the whole course os nature shall have been reversed. A
happier abode awaits us in tlte fizr PVest,· there we shall find another
Golden Age.

1. Altera aetas, ‘a second generation’, that of Marius and
Sulla being probably the first.

2. Cf. Ι. 9, ιο.

3. quam is the relative to the object (understood) of perdemus
in line 9. This may be urbem or ctbitatem.

3. finitimi. This has no special force as applied to the Marsi,
the Etruscans being nearer neighbours to Rome, and Capua not more

without.

3. Marsi. The reference is not to the earlier wars, which occurred

prominent part in this (3.0. 91-88), being the leaders of the northern
division of the confederates. They were among the last to submit.

4, Porsenae, King of Clusium and head of the Etruscan League.
Livy's patriotism prompts him to minimize the success of the Etruscan
power on this occasion (about 507 B.c.), but Tacitus uses the expres-
sion ‘dedita urbe’ (Hisa iii. 72). Porsena apparently was content
with depriving Rome of some portion of its territory, but did not
insistkon the restoration of the Tarquins, the alleged object of his
attae .

5. Capuae. Cicero speaks os the city as “altera illa Roma”
(Phil. xii. 3), and mentions it (De Lege Agraria, ii. 32) as tradi-
tionally coupled with Corinth and Carthage as cities which might
aspire to the Empire of the World. Capua was most formidable to
Rome during the second Punic war, when it opened its gates to
Hannibal (B.c. 212). It had been treated with some generosity after
the defeat at Mount Vesuvius (3.0. 340), where its forces had been
