INTRODUCTION. 21

This was the earnest of a peace which lasted, without any
interruption that affected the Empire as a whole, for more
than a century.

Effectual defence against external enemies was provided
for by the establishment of permanent camps on those fron-
tiers of the Empire which were most seriously threatened,
the Rhine and the Euphrates. At the same time a judicious
division of the provinces of the Empire was made. Those
which were not in danger of invasion were handed over to
the care of the Senate, which had the appointment of their
governors; those, on the other hand, which required mili-
tary· occupation were under the direct management of the
Emperor in his capacity of commander-in-chief, the per-

was assured by judicious acts of conciliation and amnesty.
The veteran soldiers were provided for, irrespective of the
side on which they had fought, by allotments of land; friends
of the vanquished parties were permitted to return to Italy.
Domestic reforms were energetically pressed. The Senate
was purged of unworthy members; morality was encouraged,
and license repressed by severe enactments; old temples were
rebuilt, and new ones erected. And everything was done
under constitutional forms. The Emperor was absolute, but
his power was exercised in the old names associated with the
liberties of Rome. As a permanent Proconsul, with special
powers, he could exercise his military power within the walls
of the capital; as permanent Tribune of the People he was
officially the champion os the liberties of the Commons.
The relies of Rome, at last delivered from the incessant
strife of party which had distracted her for more than a

full of extravagant adulation. Horace had not been chary
of his praises os the great general who had shattered the
combination of Roman traitors and foreign foes at Actium,
but these praises are as nothing to the flatteries which he
heaps on the man who has given peace and order to Rome.
