¹46 ODEs or HORACE.

'thtilssalso ‹ctiorlisists of a stanza os four lines in which the first three are
o us mo e —-

------ Η V v - v - -
and the fourth of this—

—————

The line is commonly divided between the fifth and sixth syllables.
But in his later examples of the metre, Horace, conscious, we may
suppose, of its monotony, frequently introduces lines where this
division, or caesura, takes place aster the sixth. In the first three
books this occurs but six times. The line ‘⁴ Quem virum aut heroa
lyra vel acri’' (XX. 1) is an instance. A somewhat similar effect is
produced in about as many more cases by the elision of a syllable,
as in “imbrium divina avis imminentum ’'. But in the three Sapphic
Odes of the F ourth Book there are fifteen examples, and in the
Carmen Saeculare nineteen. In the Alcaic stanza, on the other hand,
where the variety of rhythm is greater, Horace allows himself less
license in the later than in the earlier Odes. In this selection VIII.,
ΧΧ., XXIV. are written in the Sapphic metre.

F inally, there are three metres which have the name of Asclepiad.

(1) Extract XVIII. is of this model—

vvvvvvvv

the first line being named a Glyconic‚ the second an Asclepiad.*
The metre is called the First Asclepiad. > (Sometimes it is called the

Second, the First consisting of Asclepiad verses only.)
(2) Extract XXIII. is of this model—

- ----- ψΛΛΛ-ψψ

—VV

————————

Lines 1, 2, 3 are Asclepiads‚ line 4 a Glyconic. T-his is called the
Second (otherwise the Third) Asclepiad.
(3) Extract V. is of this model-

------ n—vv—vv
—————— n—vv-vv

———————

————————

Lines 1, 2 are Asclepiads, line 3 a Pherecratic, line 4 a Glyconic.
This is the Third (or Fourth) Asclepiad.
