76 ODEs OF HORACE.

1, 2. novi fluctus. There are new troubles, and all that has
been done will be undone. You will be at sea again.

2. fortiter occupa, ‘make first for the harbour with all your
strength ’. Occnpa has the sense of anticipating the danger.

4—6. latus, malus, and antennae may all be subjects of gemant,
as Orelli thinks, or sit may be supplied with nudum remigio, and
again with saueius Africo. 'l‘he latter seems preferable. The
trouble of each part is described-the side is swept bare os oars,
the mast is broken, the yard-arms groan.

6. gemant ; vider ut gemant is a case of zeugma.

6. funibus, these are the ropes for undergirding the ships; cf.
Acts, xxvii. 17. They are sometimes used in modern navigation.
Sir James C. Ross’s ships, when returning from his Antarctic ex-
ploration (1839-43), were undergirded.

7. carinae. This plural is not easily explained. Page ingeniously
suggests the two sides of the keel which the undergirding ropes are
supposed to keep together. Orelli suggests a possible precedent in
the usage of some older poet. Some MSS. have cavernae, which,
however, should properly mean ‘the hold '.

8. imperiosius, ‘too tyrannous’‚ or ‘more tyrannous than ‘ever'.

9, 10. The sails are torn (non sunt integra lintea), the very gods
are broken. These were the images which were put on the stern as
objects of the sailors' prayers, “ accipit et pictos puppis adunca deos '’
(Ovid, Her. xvi. 112). Possibly, ‘you have no gods on whom to
call '‚ i. e. ‘you have exhausted the favour os heaven ’.

1 1. Pontica pinus. The pines of Pontus were famous as material
for shipbuilding. Catullus's pinnace was made from Pontic timber.
“Trucemve Ponticum sinum, Ι ubi iste post phaselus antea fuit,
comata silva ’'. It is better, perhaps, to have a comma only aster
malo. ⁴ You are in poor plight, however famous your ori 'n.‘ Just
as the ship, when its sails are rent and its tutelary gods roken or
desaced, finds no help in having been built of timber from famous
forests, so the state will not be served in its need by all the splendid
associations of its history. -

14. pictis. The comparison is carried on. As the bright col-
ouring of the ship gives no confidence to the sailor, so all magni-
ficence and show of wealth will not avail the state.

15, 16. If you are not doomed to make sport sor the winds (in
which case no counsel or cantion would be of any avail), beware!

t 1127. nuper, once, in the days when he was himself an actor in the
s r1 e.

17. sollicitum taedium, ‘an anxiety and a weariness '.

18. desiderium, ‘object os my love and grave interest’. The
personal anxiety was gone, but the patriotic interest remained.
