They met at Luca (Lacca), near ’ th'e northern border of
Etruria, in 56, and divided the Empire between them. The
bargain carne into force in the next year. Pompey and
Crassus became Consuls, and with their encouragement the
Tribune Trebonius proposed a law by which Caesar's com-
mand was continued for a second period of five years;
Pompeius had assigned to him the provinces of Africa and
Spain; while Crassus received Syria. Cicero felt his career
as a political leader to be at an end, and devoted himself to
letters and philosophy. In 53 Crassus disappeared from the
scene. He had discovered that the fame of a conqueror was
necessary if he was to hold his own among the virtual rulers
of Rome. This fame Pompeius had won in the East and
Caesar was winning in the West. The only field that seemed
open to him was the conquest of the Parthian kingdom. The
campaign which followed was a series of follies and disasters,
and ended in his defeat and death at Carrhae.

Pompeius and Caesar now stood face to sace as rivals for
supreme power. Julia,1 who had been a bond of union be-
tween the two, had died the year before (54). The crisis
carne in 49. Caesar desired to stand for the consulship in
the autumn of that year, and to do so without coming to
Rome. The Senate‚ led, half unwillingly, by Pompeius, re-
quired that he should disband his legions, or, if he kept his
command, which naturally lasted till the end of the year,
should give up all idea of the consulship. Caesar answered
by crossing the Rubicon.² A few weeks afterwards he was
in Rome, and practically master of Italy. Pompeius had
evacuated Brundisium, where he had made his last stand for
the possession of the peninsula, on March 17th. On the 9th
of August in the following year he was disastrously defeated
at Pharsalia, in Thessaly, and on the 29th os September was
dead. Two years later (J uly, 46), after a series of vigorous
