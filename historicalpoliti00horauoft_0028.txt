24 ODES OF HORACE.

ability.¹ He had taken a principal part in the reconciliation
of Augustus and Antony‚ which went by the name of the
Treaty of Brundisium. He conducted a campaign in 39
against one of the Illyrian tribes, and gained successes
which were rewarded with a triumph. It was Antony who
appointed him to the command, and when the war of
Actium broke out he pleaded his obligations to Antony as
a reason why he should be excused from taking an active
part in it. Augustus admitted the excuse. Pollio from that
time devoted himself to literature and to his profession as an
advocate. It will be seen that there is a tone of impartiality
in the poem eminently suited to Pollio's character. The
‘ friendships of the great ² are full of trouble for the state, and
Augustus was one of the principes. The writer must have
been well established in imperial favour before he could ven-
ture to use such language. The words nondum expiatis·
uncta cruoribus, ‘steeped in bloodshed not yet atoned for',
have been taken to indicate that the civil war was but just
finished; but the tone of the whole accounts for the ‘ not yet'
without any consideration of time. The word might have
been used in the same connection twenty years later.

To the year 28 also belong the seven odes, XL—XVII.
Augustus was endeavouring to bring about a revival in
religion and a reformation in m'orals. In morals his own
example was but of indifferent value, but his simplicity of
life was worthy of all admiration. Suetonius speaks with
emphasis of the modest size and unpretending style of his
dwelling. The first house that he occupied was near the
Forum, and had belonged to the orator Calvus.,· the second,
though in the more dignified quarter of the Palatine Hill,
had been the dwelling of Hortensius, and was neither large
nor splendid. The colonnade which surrounded it was low
and made of ordinary stone; the rooms were not adorned
with foreign marbles or with elaborate pavements. For more
than forty years he used the same bed-chamber‚ winter and
summer. In remarkable contrast to this private frugality

¹ ¹ He is the Pollio of the famous Fourth Eclogue of Virgil. A son bomin his
consulship (40 1³.c.), and possibly a son of his, was to bring in the Golden Age.
