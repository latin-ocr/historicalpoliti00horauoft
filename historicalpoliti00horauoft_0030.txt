make him curb his own passions. ln 39 his wife Scribonia
bore him a daughter, afterwards known as the famous
or infamous Julia. On the very day of the infant's birth
the mother was divorced, to make room for Livia, then
the wife of Tiberius Nero. Livia was the mother of two
sons, one of them born aster her marriage to Augustus 3 but
the Emperor had no child by her. Accordingly he found
himself, after more than ten years of marriage, without a
male heir. Under these circumstances he adopted M.
Claudius Marcellus, son of his sister Octavia,l and gave him
his daughter Julia, then in her fifteenth year, in marriage.
The young man, whose promise and early fate have been
immortalized by Virgil's lines (Aen. vi. 860-886), died in the
autumn of 2 3. Horace's poem must have been written after
the adoption, and of course before the death. Till the young'
man had been formally made a member of the Julian gens,

odes were published at the same time in their collected form.
Many of them, doubtless, had been in circulation before.
The latest date that can be assigned to the collected publi-
cation is the earlier half of the year 23.

The Fourth Book of the Odes appeared ten years later.
One lyric poem, not included in any one of the books, was
given to the world during this interval. In the year 17
Augustus celebrated the Secular Games, a solemn act of
prayer and thanksgiving to Apollo and Diana, who were
singled out for this honour as the gods that had the care of
the health of Rome. The seculum was a period of uncertain
length. Augustus took its duration to be 110 years. The
year that he fixed upon for the celebration was the year of
the renewed grant of the Imperium to himself. (It had
already been renewed for ten years in 27.) The keepers of
the Sibylline books did not fail to find the required authority

¹ This is probably the same Octavia that was married to Antony. Some,
however, suppose Antony's wife to have been an elder Octavia, half-sister to
Augustus. ² But see note on XX. 47.
