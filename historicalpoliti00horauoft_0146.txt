142 ODES OF HORACE.

belongs to the later period when Tiridates had been expelled. The
reference in the passage in 1. xxxiv. 14—16 is general, if, indeed, it is

a reference at all:—
“ hinc apicem rapax
Fortuna eum stridore acuto
sustulit, hic posuisse gaudet ¹¹,

(the word apex appears to be used of the lofty tiara of an Eastern
iiiiigb) In Verg. Aen. it is applied to the tall cap worn by the Salii,
Another general reference introduces other events (111. viii. 17—

24)·— “mitte civiles super Urbe curas 3

occidit Daci Cotisonis agmen,

Medus infestus sibi luctuosis

dissidet armis,
servit Hispanae vetus hostis orae
Cantaber sera domitus catena,

iam Scythae laxo meditantur arcu
cedere campis ''.

Cotiso was defeated by M. Crassus in 30 A. D., and later, at some
time unknown, by a Lentulus. If we prefer to take the earlier date,
the passage suits very well the position which we know Maecenas to
have occupied at Rome during the years 31-29. Augustus left Rome
early in 31 and returned to it in August, 29. While he was absent
Maecenas was vicegerent. A very similar passage occurs in 111. xxix.
25 28. “ tu, civitatie-Imbquisllqlesseattstatus,
curas, e Γ 150 lCl US lmeS,

quid Seres et regnata Cyro
Bactra parent, Tanaisque discors''.

It is true that Augustus left Rome again in 27, and was 'absent
for nearly three years. Maecenas may have occupied the same
position as before, but this is not probable. Agrippa, who had been
actively engaged in the Actium campaign, was now resident in
Rome. (Mommsen thinks that he held the proconsulare imperium.)
And Agrippa, as the emperor's son-in-law, must have had prece-
dence even of Maecenas. On the whole, it seems better to take the
earlier of the two dates for these references.

The phrase used of the Cantabri, “ fera domitus catena”, might
seem to prove the contrary, but that it proves too much. This tribe
was not finally subdued till the year 19, when, after a fierce resis-
tance, in which half their number is said to have perished, they were
compelled to quit their mountain homes and to occupy the lower
valleys. But this year is too late a date for the Third Book of the
Odes. It must be allowed, however, that the expression does favour,
on the whole, the later date. In 25 Augustus was in Spain, and
won great victories over the Cantabri, who elsewhere are spoken of

as unconquered, as in 11. vi. 2—·
